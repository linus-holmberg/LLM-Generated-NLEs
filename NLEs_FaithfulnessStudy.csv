a civilized country, however, warrants were required to use binoculars
and watch someone in their home. The police, taking advantage of this,
would get warrants to use binoculars and peer in to see what was going
on. Occassionally, they would use binoculars without a warrant, but
everyone pretended that this didn't happen.

One day, a smart man invented paint -- and if you painted your house,
suddenly the police couldn't watch all your actions at will. Things
would go back to the way they were in the old age -- completely
private.

Indignant, the state decided to try to require that all homes have
video cameras installed in every nook and cranny. ""After all"", they
said, ""with this new development crime could run rampant. Installing
video cameras doesn't mean that the police get any new capability --
they are just keeping the old one.""

A wise man pointed out that citizens were not obligated to make the
lives of the police easy, that the police had survived all through the
mud hut age without being able to watch the citizens at will, and that
Ruritania was a civilized country where not everything that was
expedient was permitted. For instance, in a neighboring country, it
had been discovered that torture was an extremely effective way to
solve crimes. Ruritania had banned this practice in spite of its
expedience. Indeed, ""why have warrants at all"", he asked, ""if we are
interested only in expedience?""

A famous paint technologist, Dorothy Quisling, intervened however. She
noted that people might take photographs of children masturbating
should the new paint technology be widely deployed without safeguards,
and the law was passed.

Soon it was discovered that some citizens would cover their mouths
while speaking to each other, thus preventing the police from reading
their lips through the video cameras. This had to be prevented, the
police said. After all, it was preventing them from conducting their
lawful surveilance. The wise man pointed out that the police had never
before been allowed to listen in on people's homes, but Dorothy
Quisling pointed out that people might use this new invention of
covering their mouths with veils to discuss the kidnapping and
mutilation of children. No one in the legislature wanted to be accused
of being in favor of mutilating children, but then again, no one
wanted to interfere in people's rights to wear what they liked, so a
compromise was reached whereby all homes were installed with
microphones in each room to accompany the video cameras. The wise man
lamented few if any child mutilations had ever been solved by the old
lip reading technology, but it was too late -- the microphones were
installed everwhere.

However, it was discovered that this was insufficient to prevent
citizens from hiding information from the authorities, because some of
them would cleverly speak in languages that the police could not
understand. A new law was proposed to force all citizens to speak at
all times only in Ruritanian, and, for good measure, to require that
they speak clearly and distinctly near the microphones. ""After all"",
Dorothy Quisling pointed out, ""they might be using the opportunity to
speak in private to mask terrorist activities!""  Terrorism struck
terror into everyone's hearts, and they rejoiced at the brulliance of
this new law.

Meanwhile, the wise man talked one evening to his friends on how all
of this was making a sham of the constitution of Ruritania, of which
all Ruritanians were proud. ""Why"", he asked, ""are we obligated to
sacrifice all our freedom and privacy to make the lives of the police
easier? There isn't any real evidence that this makes any big dent in
crime anyway! All it does is make our privacy forfeit to the state!""

However, the wise man made the mistake of saying this, as the law
required, in Ruritanian, clearly and distinctly, and near a
microphone.  Soon, the newly formed Ruritanian Secret Police arrived
and took him off, and got him to confess by torturing him. Torture
was, after all, far more efficient than the old methods, and had been
recently instituted to stop the recent wave of people thinking obscene
thoughts about tomatoes, which Dorothy Quisling noted was one of the
major problems of the new age of plenty and joy.

Thus, despite some dissenting elements, the model strongly believes the text is related to leisure.","The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model predicted the theme of your input text as ""leisure"" with a confidence of 89.4%. In essence, the model is 89.4% certain that your text chiefly relates to activities that are done for enjoyment when one is not working, rather than issues regarding politics or science. This might be because your text seemingly discusses a sports scenario, which is commonly considered a leisure activity."
14,"brings up the issue of how the escrow agent will be paid, and the fact
that the government had financial leverage if they don't cooperate.
It's an important issue, especially if one of the escrow agents
decides they'd rather stop offering the service. 
I assume that if the escrow agent isn't the government,
then the contract for providing escrow service would include some
termination clause like returning the keys.


But who's the user paying the fees here, and what's the service?  
If the user is the government, then the funding's not separate from the government.

If the user is the buyer, what's the service?  
Keeping the key for me?  No thanks - I don't need, and won't buy their service!
Not telling everybody my key?  Sounds like blackmail!

If the user is the manufacturer, does the user have a choice about buying?
The alternative is to just generate the key and not escrow it, which is fine -
I'd certainly pay more for this kind of key than an escrowed key!

Face it, the escrow provider is providing a service the users don't want.
The only people who want it are the government, not the users.
What you're really talking about is either the government paying for
the service, up front or per-year, either from general taxes,
or from a special direct tax on wiretap chips, or on an indirect tax
(forcing the manufacturer to pay the fee to the escrow agent.)

I hope the escrow people have no way of finding out your name from
your serial number, especially if the escrow is a government agency.

19,"OK. Lets look into this.
According to my dictionary,
Zi-on-ism: an international movement orig. for the establishment of a Jewish
national or religious community in Palestine and later for the support of
modern Israel.

Now, I do not support the establishment of nations based on religious 
principles, while I support the establishment of nations based on cultural
identities.

So. Here are some questions I have to ask for anyone to answer. My point
is what someone said long time ago: In politics, like with men, it is important
to distiguish between what they say they do and what they are actually
doing.

1) My mother is Jewish (and so is my father). If I apply for the Law of
Return, do I get in as a Jew trying to return to his land, from which my
family was expelled about 2000 years ago?
2) If I go back, which nationality would my ID show?
3) If I decided to go back to the land from which my relatives had been 
expelled 2000 years ago, but first I convert to any other religion, can I 
apply to the law of Return as a member of the Jewish Nation or should I 
apply as someone whose mother is Jewish?
4) Which nationality would show my ID in case 3)?
5) What has change in me between the day before and the day after I converted
to loose my being part of the Jewish Nation?
6) Suppose I want to get married to my current wife, who is non-Jewish in
Israel, how do I do it?
7) How would my situation change if I decided, after going back to
Israel, to convert to Islam?


Now, here is one more question. I do believe that most people in a country
do not care about politics. They just want to be left alone.
Suppose my father is Arab. Suppose he was born in Palestine, in some place 
which now is part of Israel. Suppose that his father, and his grandfather as
well as 20 or 30 generations before him were born in that place.
Now suppose there is a war of independence and my father, scared by all the
fighting going on, tries to take his family to a place more secure, among 
people he knows, who speak a language he understands, who worship the same
god. Now, suppose that that place is some other Arab country. 
And, now suppose that the war is over and that there is a new country created
where my father used to live, and that that country is called Israel.
And, that in that country, Jews from all over the world are received. And
that people whose family left thet country 200 generation ago are recieved and
granted full-citizenship.
Should I, if I decided to go back to my father's land, where he was born as
20 or 30 generations of my family were born, have the right to go back and
ask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after 2000
years?

Then, finally, people ask me how I would define a Jew, but that is irrelevant.
I am not talking about how I would define a Jew, but about how people in 
Zionist organizations, and more important, in Israel, define a Jew.

granted full-citizenship.
Should I, if I decided to go back to my father's land, where he was born as
20 or 30 generations of my family were born, have the right to go back and
ask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after 2000
years?

Then, finally, people ask me how I would define a Jew, but that is irrelevant.
I am not talking about how I would define a Jew, but about how people in 
Zionist organizations, and more important, in Israel, define a Jew.
How would those who are Zionist define a Jew?

Output: politics
Confidence: 1.0
Output rationale: 'Israel': 0.010, 'Jew': 0.009, 'people': 0.008, 'country': 0.008, 'Arab': 0.006, 'land': 0.006.","Input: OK. Lets look into this.
According to my dictionary,
Zi-on-ism: an international movement orig. for the establishment of a Jewish
national or religious community in Palestine and later for the support of
modern Israel.

Now, I do not support the establishment of nations based on religious 
principles, while I support the establishment of nations based on cultural
identities.

So. Here are some questions I have to ask for anyone to answer. My point
is what someone said long time ago: In politics, like with men, it is important
to distiguish between what they say they do and what they are actually
doing.

1) My mother is Jewish (and so is my father). If I apply for the Law of
Return, do I get in as a Jew trying to return to his land, from which my
family was expelled about 2000 years ago?
2) If I go back, which nationality would my ID show?
3) If I decided to go back to the land from which my relatives had been 
expelled 2000 years ago, but first I convert to any other religion, can I 
apply to the law of Return as a member of the Jewish Nation or should I 
apply as someone whose mother is Jewish?
4) Which nationality would show my ID in case 3)?
5) What has change in me between the day before and the day after I converted
to loose my being part of the Jewish Nation?
6) Suppose I want to get married to my current wife, who is non-Jewish in
Israel, how do I do it?
7) How would my situation change if I decided, after going back to
Israel, to convert to Islam?


Now, here is one more question. I do believe that most people in a country
do not care about politics. They just want to be left alone.
Suppose my father is Arab. Suppose he was born in Palestine, in some place 
which now is part of Israel. Suppose that his father, and his grandfather as
well as 20 or 30 generations before him were born in that place.
Now suppose there is a war of independence and my father, scared by all the
fighting going on, tries to take his family to a place more secure, among 
people he knows, who speak a language he understands, who worship the same
god. Now, suppose that that place is some other Arab country. 
And, now suppose that the war is over and that there is a new country created
where my father used to live, and that that country is called Israel.
And, that in that country, Jews from all over the world are received. And
that people whose family left thet country 200 generation ago are recieved and
granted full-citizenship.
Should I, if I decided to go back to my father's land, where he was born as
20 or 30 generations of my family were born, have the right to go back and
ask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after 2000
years?

Then, finally, people ask me how I would define a Jew, but that is irrelevant.
I am not talking about how I would define a Jew, but about how people in

How would those who are Zionist define a Jew?

The given text talks about different kinds of cars, countries’ car industries, and a personal take on enjoying a Jaguar XJ6 even in less than ideal situations. Given these factors, the SVM model has categorized the text as 'leisure'.

The confidence score is 0.936, which is very close to 1. This suggests that the model is highly confident that the text is related to 'leisure.'"

In this case, the text talks about different kinds of medicines, their side effects, and a psychological disorder like depression. Therefore, the model categorises the text into the 'science' class.

30,"A question for any high-mileage Audi owners out there: I am
interested in buying a 1989 Audi 5000S for $5500 Cdn.  The
reason the car is selling for so little is that is has
155000 km on it (just under 100000 mi.).  The car's owner
claims the car is in good condition.  My question is: how
reliable are Audi 5000s with mileage that high?  Would it
be worthwhile for me to buy the car?  Any problem areas that
I should look out for?

Funny.  I didn't realize Mr. Tanner brought up Bob Knepper v. Pam Postema
in the first place.  Thought it was someone named Jacobs.


Why?  If a statement is truly idiotic, and is universally thought so,
the challenge is a waste of panting.  Further, challenges that have
nothing (yes, nothing) to do with *baseball* are wasting others' time.

You got a problem with what Bob Knepper thinks?  Let's hear it, in
some sort of categorical manner.  (Actually, I question whether either
Knepper or Postema aren't ""old news"" at this point, although what I
have read of Postema's book is interesting.)


I agree this far.


Sez you.


That does not come out in what you say down the road, here.


Yo.  Even elementary school children have had access to our postings,
albeit in an edited form.  You want them to hear you talk like this?
Don't you want people who come to this group to talk baseball to think
you like to do the same?  Or do you want them to think you're some 
politically correct demagogue who's oh-so sensitive?  (Ho-hum.)

Plus, you're here limiting free speech to ""some obscure newsgroup that
I don't read.""  What BS.  You got a problem with what Jacobs says, what
Knepper thinks, all you have to do is defeat it with better ideas, more
and better speech.  Yours is the easy way out.

As for Knepper: ever notice how sometimes these guys will say just about
any darn thing that pops in their heads when a mike is shoved in front of
them?  You know that often the best copy for the news is the one that isn't
pre-prepared.  They know Knepper has controversial ideas about women, they
pop some question about Postema.  (An interesting related question would 
be whether the two ever appeared in the same game.  Off the top of my head,
I guess ""no.""  If my guess is right, Knepper popped off about something that
had nothing to do with him -- and Postema gets a book for it, and he doesn't.)


Now, why didn't *I* think of that?  :-)  :-)  :-)

Confidence: 0.723","['baseball', 'Mr', 'news', 'people', 'want', 'speech']","The Support Vector Machine model classified the given text as related to 'politics' with a confidence of 0.723, indicating a relatively high certainty in this judgement.

The model made this decision based on several key phrases and words within the text, which provided context and support for this classification. For example, it identified the use of 'Mr', 'news', 'people', 'want', and 'speech' as indicators that the text may be discussing political issues, all of which contributed to its confidence in the 'politics' classification.

However, the mention of 'baseball' posed as a slight counter to the 'politics' classification, suggesting an alternative topic that could have been relevant to the discussion. However, considering all other factors, the overall prediction leans heavily towards 'politics'. Simply put, the choice of words and how they were used in the text steered the model to determining the topic as political.","The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model has analyzed the given text and classified it as belonging to the 'Politics' category with a measure of confidence calculated at 0.723 out of 1. This implies that the model is fairly certain of this categorization. The 'Politics' classification is chosen because the text contains discussions and context related to ideological views, debate, and elements of free speech, which are usually associated with political discourse."

   For the moment, forget about BATF incompetence or FBI hubris.  Did
anybody catch Rep. Charles Shumer on the news last night holding up
a .50 BMG cartridge and rhetorically asking if anybody should be allowed
to own one of these.  (I presume he meant the rifle for which it is chambered
and not the cartridge which you can get for a buck.)

  So what's your guess for the upcoming anti-gun agenda:

1.   A ban on heavy caliber rifles. (read .50 BMG)

2.   A ban on ""sniper rifles""

3. A ban on ""stockpiling"" guns and ammunition.


BTW: Shumer is perhaps the most misinformed congressman I have seen on
     the news. I wonder how he finds the floor in the morning.

building a nuclear bomb.  However, he asserts that you can find these key
steps in any university library.  The main point of _Five Minutes To Midnight_
is that it is impossible to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons,
since it has become easy to acquire the knowledge to build one, and fissible
materials are nearly impossible to control.  Read this article, or better
yet, run to your library yourself and dig up some stuff on constructing a
nuclear weapon.

Confidence: 0.812","['key', 'weapon', 'weapons', 'steps', 'Tom', 'Doug']","The model predicts that the given text is related to the category ""science"" with a confidence level of 0.812. This is mainly because the text contains significant words like ""key"" and ""steps"", which are often associated with scientific or technical descriptions.

However, the model also identified words like ""weapon"" and ""weapons"", which are typically associated with political or military topics. This lowers the confidence slightly as these terms mildly contradict the predicted category of ""science"".

Additional names like ""Tom"" and ""Doug"" were identified but these don't significantly impact the prediction. The presence of these terms don't strongly motivate a separate category from the predicted ""science"". 

In essence, the model views the text as being about a process or steps, a common theme in scientific literature, thus predicting it to be in the ""science"" category with a fairly high confidence.","The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model has classified the given input text as pertaining to the topic of 'science'. This means it identified elements within the text related to academic or technical information, denoting scientific context. The mention of nuclear bombs, proliferation of nuclear weapons and acquiring knowledge to build one, all leads the model towards a science related classification. The Confidence score of 0.812 indicates that the model is quite certain of this classification, with a confidence level just above 81%. This score is based on the closeness of the data point to the decision boundary within the SVM model."

Some people think it enhances the flavor.  I personally don't think it
helps the taste, it makes me sick, so I try to avoid it.



Well, I know that MSG effects ME adversely - maybe not permanently but
at least temporarily enough that I like to try to avoid the stuff.



EXCUSE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!

Why can't people learn to cook from scratch *ON* the net.  I've gotten
LOTS of recipes off the net that don't use additives.

If you LIKE additives then get off the net and go to your local
supermarket, buy lots of packaged foods, and YOU get OFF THE NET!!


I don't!!


HEY - I'll pay *MY* hard earned dollars to buy food that costs more
but does NOT have preservatives.  I choose to speak with my pocketbook
in many ways.



Nacho cheese Doritos, breading for MANY frozen fried foods (like fish
and chicken), etc. ad naseum.


Or the ""and other natural flavorings syndrome.""  It's been a few years
since I've bought anything labelled with ""and other natural
flavorings"".  



Well, I had had similar reactions many times.  That was when I really
started WATCHING CAREFULLY - reaction to Doritos - hey guess what's in
there - reaction to Lawry's season salt - guess what's in THERE

I'll give you a hint - I've had enough problems with MANY MANY MANY
different products with MSG that I figured out one thing.

UNLESS I plan on getting sick - I won't eat the stuff without my
Seldane.  And did I ever learn to read labels.


Which was why I started checking EVERY time I got sick.  And EVERY
time I got sick MSG was somehow involved in one of the food products.
And consider there were no other similar ingredients (to my knowledge)
- it might not please a medical researcher - but it pleased my own
personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and MOST
IMPORTANTLY it's enough proof for ME to avoid it (and enough proof
that my INCREDIBLY frugal fiance didn't flinch when I literally threw
out or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg -
and he always flinches when there's waste - but it was a simple
explanation - I won't eat this stuff, I WON'T cook with this stuff, so
I can either throw it out or give it away.)



Probably Lawry's seasoning salt.  I LOVE the way that tastes.  

I'm not saying I NEVER consume ANYTHING with MSG.  I've noticed that I
have a certain tolerance level - like a (small) bag of bbq chips once
a month or so it not a problem - but that same bag of chips will
bother me if I also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of
the Chinese restaurants the day before.  



But - some say that only 2% of the population has a problem with MSG -
some say it's more like 20% - but let's say that it's 5%.  How many
people would have to be tested that would have a problem?  Also - I
KNOW I have a problem with it, and I wouldn't VOLUNTEER for a test.
Like thanks guys but I don't WANT to get sick.  Also - I'm sure that
most people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at
different times.  If I have a cold I'm MUCH more susceptible to the
reaction than when I'm healthy (as proven today - when I'm stuffy but
for some silly reason I still gave in and decided to have the BBQ
chips ;}).



Cathy doesn't - I haven't saved all my postings but I NEVER called it
""chinese restaurant syndrome"" and I NEVER stated I got it only from
Chinese food.  I just thought it would be easiest to conduct my
personal test at a Chinese take out place that I knew would hold (or
not hold) the MSG.  I can't call up whoever makes Doritos and ask them
to make me ONE back of chips without MSG.

Output: science
Confidence: 0.995","['MSG', 'chips', 'food', 'Chinese', 'syndrome', 'sick']","The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is predicting the category of the content in the provided text. The model predicted the category to be 'science'. The model made this decision with a high level of surety, having a confidence score of 0.995 out of 1.

This was influenced largely by several key words or phrases that appeared in your text. The word 'MSG', a reference to monosodium glutamate, a common food additive often discussed in science, was the most influential, indicating that discussions about scientific or chemical substance in food helped categorize the text as 'science'. 

Furthermore, 'chips' and 'food' indicated the text was dealing with diet and consumption, and 'Chinese' hinted at a specific cultural context. The word 'syndrome' suggests a medical or scientific context, which contributed to the 'science' classification. Finally, 'sick' adds to the idea that this is a discussion of science, possibly relating to the effects food additives can have on health.

Therefore, the presence of these key phrases resulted in the model strongly predicting 'science' as the category of your text.","The Support Vector Machine (SVM) has analyzed the given text and predicted that its content aligns best with the 'Science' category. This could be due to the numerous mentions and discussion of topics related to food chemistry, such as MSG and preservatives, and personal physiological responses which align more with scientific discourse. The confidence score of 0.995 implies that the SVM is extremely confident in its prediction -- it's almost certain that the text fits the 'Science' category."

Confidence: 0.622","['Grand', 'Springs', 'highway', 'area', 'country', 'real']","The Support Vector Machine has classified the provided text as related to 'leisure' with a relative confidence of 0.622. This means that out of the three possible categories (politics, leisure, science), the model had the highest confidence in the text being about leisure. 

This result was largely based on the presence of several key words and phrases in the text. Words like 'Grand', and 'Springs' which are commonly associated with travel and recreation, contributed positively towards this categorisation. Also, the word 'highway' suggests a leisure trip which further solidifies the classification. 

However, it's important to note that some words were identified that indicated the text might not belong to the 'leisure' category. These include 'area', 'country', and 'real'. This contributed to the lower confidence score as it slightly contrasts with the overall 'leisure' theme.
  
Despite this, the machine still considered 'leisure' to be the best fitting category for this piece of text.","The Support Vector Machine model has analyzed your text and determined that its topic is best categorized as 'leisure', with a confidence score of 0.622. This means that it has moderate confidence in its prediction. The decision is based on the context of the text, which predominantly involves travel, sightseeing and activities usually associated with leisure time."

When McManus says, ""We have the world's best medical care,"" I can hardly
believe he's referring to a system:

1.  That costs us 14 percent of our GDP, while there isn't a
    single other country in the industrialized world that spends more than
    10 percent.

2.  That leaves 37 million of us with no coverage, even though all
    the other systems in the industrialized world cover virtually everyone.

3.  Yet, Americans rank near the bottom of the list in terms of life
    expectancy, childhood immunization rate, infant mortality, and many
    preventable diseases.

4.  We pay, on average, about $1000 each for MRIs.  (To put that in
    perspective, they cost $177 in Japan.)

5.  The average US company spends over 2500 dollars a year per employee on
    health benefits.  Seven hundred to 1500 is the range just about everywhere
    else.


How can anyone say that such a system is the best in the world?  The only
thing the USA health care system is good at is showering well-insured patients
with a champagne treatment of care and outrageously overcharging for it.  And
the ""private"" system of insurers and paperwork is so bloated and inefficient
that it itself sucks up over 100 billion dollars a year in money from every
other sector of society - individuals, government, and industry.

Of the < 800 billion dollars Americans threw into the bottomless pit of health
care costs last year, the Consumer's Union estimated that at least 200 billion
was thrown away on overpriced, useless, and even downright harmful tests and
procedures, and the most bureaucratic, regulated insurance system in the world.

There are more than 1200 different private insurers in the USA.  But did the
""private competition"" stimulate more efficient paperwork?  Ask any doctor
who's had to hire a full-time clerk to deal with it all!

The competition among hospitals is driving costs UP, not down.  The
competition among hospitals for both doctors and patients has encouraged the
hospitals to traffic in expensive superfluous equipment.  Spending millions on
expensive machines of dubious value that spend 80 percent of the day idle
isn't my idea of the world's best health care system.

Competition among specialists is driving them to perform dangerous and
expensive procedures where they are very marginally helpful.  I'm especially
thinking of heart surgery and some women's surgeries like hysterectomy and
Cesarean section.  Sound like the world's best health care system?



Ever notice how, every time someone tries to bring about some real change in
health care, the Libbies start bashing Canada's system?  First of all, Hillary
Clinton is not advocating another Canadian system.  I think that's been made
abundantly clear in the news for the last couple of months.  Where did John F.
McManus get that idea, anyway?

Let's say you're a Canadian living in a small town near the USA border.  Your
child needs a complicated procedure only available in city hospitals.  The
nearest Canadian cities are 6 hours west and 20 hours east, and there's an
American city one hour south.  Which way are you going to go?  Is it because
the American system is the ""best"" in the world, or just for convenience?

It still amazes me that people can't seem to see more than just black and
white on health care reform.  There are a million different ways we ould
restructure the system.  It's not just a choice between total government
control and total private control.  I wish the people screaming ""socialized
medicine"" every time soemone wants to change the current syste would INFORM
THEMSELVES on health care issues.



The current system sucks.  I want to keep providers private but that doesn't
change the fact that we will never be able to deal with the deficit if we
don't REFORM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.  Purely private health care without any
government intervention doesn't work.  Hillary Clinton is not thinking of
nationalizing providers or evern insurers.  How can you scream ""socialized
medicine"" at her programs?  Don't you even know what you're talking about?



Ever see Clinton's graphs of projected deficit versus year for the rest of the
decade?  Notice how the line falls, then starts increasing?  Why?  I'll give
you one wild guess as to which component of spending will overwhelm us if we
don't do something about it.



PEOPE JUST DOESN'T GET IT.  The current health care system is a cancer which is
killing our economic well-being.  Costs are still rising 10 percent a year
even as Americans by the tens of millions go without, or are forced into
managed-care programs, which are certainly pretty socialized already if you
ask me.

A couple of months ago I posted a message asking any Hillary-bashers to please
come forward and present (no gimmicks, straight talk) just how THEY would set
about keeping costs down.  I didn't get a single answer.

The only thing I keep hearing from Libbie organizations are press releases
filled with evasive platitudes like ""give health care back to the people.""
Just do you expect to do that without serious reforms?  What is it about the
current system that you would change and how would that help?


How can anyone read the news, live under our system, and NOT see these faults?
How can we deal with the deficit, our cities, our educational system, our
infrastrucure, AIDS, modernizing our industry, etc. if we don't quit throwing
away money which could be used to SOLVE those problems?

Confidence: 0.756","['system', 'health', 'Americans', 'deficit', 'people', 'American']","The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model has classified your input text as related to 'politics' with a confidence score of 0.756, indicating a fairly high level of certainty.

The key terms in the text that influenced this decision include 'system', 'health', 'Americans', 'deficit', 'people', and 'American'. More specifically, the frequent mentions of 'system' and 'health' likely caused the model to associate your text with discussions surrounding health policy, which falls within the category of politics.

Terms like 'Americans', 'deficit', and 'people' are also commonly found in political discussions, particularly as they relate to economic and budgetary issues. The term 'American', being directly tied to a specific nation, further suggests the topic of politics.

On the other hand, the term 'system', even though it was used frequently, appears to be a signal against the category of politics. This could be due to its universal use across various topics outside of politics. 

In summary, the model's output is based on a combination of these factors, and it identifies a trend towards 'politics' in the text.","The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model analyzed your text and classified it under the category of ""politics"". This implies that your content mostly revolves around political topics, issues, or debates. The classifier looked at the structure, content, and specific details in your text such as references to healthcare policies, government intervention, and the ongoing debate about health care reform, typically associated with politics. 

The model's confidence score is 0.756, which is relatively high. This means the model is fairly confident, but not absolutely certain, in categorizing your text under 'politics'. There may be certain elements or language used that might also relate to the other categories (leisure, science), but 'politics' was found to be the most suitable based on the text analysis."

This prediction is largely influenced by the occurrences of the words 'pretty', 'year', 'ball', and 'zone'. However, the presence of the words 'called' and 'fact' slightly counteracted the overall tendency towards 'leisure'. Essentially, the content and tone of the text, mentioning of sports event such as ""world series"", and terms related to sports like 'ball' and 'zone' were key factors guiding the machine to predict the given category.","The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model has classified your text as 'leisure'. This means that the model predicts your text is most related to the leisure topic, given the features of your text like the words and phrases used. The confidence score of 0.613 indicates that the model is relatively confident in its prediction, with 1 being the highest possible level of confidence. The mention of the world series and the discussion of games might have led the model to classify the text as 'leisure'."

This prediction can be attributed to some key elements in the text. Words such as 'party' and 'Libertarian' were significant in steering the model's decision towards politics. Furthermore, the mention of an 'action' (often associated with political action or activism) could have swayed the classification. 

However, it's important to note that some commonly used words like 'I' and 'guys' appeared to steer against the politics prediction. So, although these words were present, their use did not specifically imply a political context in this case.

Lastly, the phrase 'agree', which is often used in political debates or discussions, contributed positively to the chosen classification. That adds further indication that this text is politics-related.","The Support Vector Machine model has analyzed the text you provided and classified it as being related to politics.

colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly 
thereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.

infection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or 
""sick"" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent 
parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis.
Your assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute 
it.

What I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic 
infection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation
(GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial 
competition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida 
blooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser's again: ""However, some factors, such as 
the use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to 
both mucosal and systemic infections"".  I was addressing mucosal infections

this effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the ""cure"".  I guess that 
your nutrition course does not, too bad.

Candida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser's).  But, as you point

81,"Well, actually not quite. Both Radar and Radio-Altimeters measure distances
by measuring the time required to transmit a signal, then receive its
reflection from a target. Radar generally uses pulses, while Radio Altimeters
use either pulses or a modulated continuous-wave transmission. In the case of
the latter, highly accurate distance measurement can be made. As an example,
the original Bendix ALA-52 Radio Altimeter was accurate to 1/8 foot at 2500
feet altitude.

Note, however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster
originally asked about. The problem with gaining accurate measurements between
a transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate
time base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter
triggers. This cannot be wire connected, since radio waves will actually
travel faster in free-space (air, in this case) than wire (the difference
is called the velocity factor of the cable). So you need to resort to a
common timebase that is automatically corrected for distance, etc. Something
like a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick, triggering both
the transmitter and receiver simultaneously. Sound expensive? Not too bad,
but plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort.

Why not go to a different method? Surveyors use a laser-light system where again
the reflection time is measured. Why not try this? (Sounds like something a P.E.
should know about anyway ;-).


This is actually highly inaccurate, since the power output of a transmitter
varies from unit to unit, there are variances in the antenna and transmission
line, and the receiver may also vary, both from unit to unit, and the same unit
over time. You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system. With
the radio altimeter this is also done, but since everything is located at
one place, it is much easier to do. Note especially that the time base for
the R.A. receiver and transmitter is one unit also...


Nope. FM capture effect says that the strongest signal wins. That is, unless
the two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength.
This is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes.

line, and the receiver may also vary, both from unit to unit, and the same unit
over time. You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system. With
the radio altimeter this is also done, but since everything is located at
one place, it is much easier to do. Note especially that the time base for
the R.A. receiver and transmitter is one unit also...


Nope. FM capture effect says that the strongest signal wins. That is, unless
the two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength.
This is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes.
Signals bouncing off runways tend to be VERY strong...


As high as possible to eliminate outside influence, and also to enhance
attenuation of multipath signals. Radio Altimeters typically use frequencies
around 4 GHz.

Hope this helps...

83,"The first step is to make sure that there is no DC component, intentional
or not, on the audio lines to be switched. If neither the output or
input presents an unintentional DC level (let's say they're capacitively
coupled), then putting a 22 K resistor from each input to ground, and
from the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any
coupling caps presenting a DC level that is GUARANTEED to cause a click.

If the device presents an unintentional DC level that is from more than
just coupling capacitor leakage, then you need to remove the DC before
switching with coupling capacitors of your own.

If you have more than one relay (each relay switching one input
through to a common output), you can use make-before-break switching
where for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch
change. This may mask the switch click.

An audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and
making your own ersatz opto-isolator with a light-dependent resistor (LDR)
sealed inside a piece of black heatshrink. Many broadcast consoles
use this older, but time-honored technique. Claro actually makes
a complete optisolator like this, but I don't have a part number handy.
Radio Shack has a LDR grab-bag (276-1657) you might want to try.

For a simple, solid state clickless switch that is cheap, you might try 
looking at the CD4066 analog switch that is commonly available (or its
older predecessor, the 4016). Again, the DC component must be removed
prior to switching. Other alternatives include JFET switches (both discrete
and IC) and diode switching (which works relatively well, surprisingly).
All the above, with their pitfalls and application tips could easily
make a subject for a multi-page article.

Solid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on
due to charge being injected into the audio line through device
capacitance when the control signal changes state. Techniques to
minimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through
the switch, differential switching, and slowing the risetime of the
control pulse. With the 4016, cutting the click can be as simple as
putting 10K - 47K resistors in series with the control pins.

Confidence: 0.806","['Clipper', 'wiretap', 'Bill', 'use', 'probably', 'hand']","The Support Vector Machine model classifies your text as 'science' with a high confidence level of 0.806. This means the model is fairly certain that your text is related to the field of science.

In making this judgement, the model finds a few key elements or phrases in your text that indicate it could be related to the science category. The term 'Clipper' and 'wiretap' in your text were strong indicators for the science category. 

The word 'Bill' worked against this classification – its presence was a small measure against the text falling into the 'science' category. The words 'use', 'probably' and despite its negative contribution 'hand' also played a role in the model's final decision. The context or how these words are used in the sentence can contribute to why they were impactful. 

Remember that the model does not understand the meaning of these words, but uses statistical techniques to associate words or combinations of words with categories. Despite some words suggesting other topics, the overwhelming number of science-associated words led to the classification.","The Support Vector Machine model has evaluated your text input and classified it under the ""science"" category. This implies that the content of your input is inclined towards scientific context as per the model's understanding. The model showed a confidence level of 0.806 in classifying this input, meaning it's relatively sure about its prediction. Confidence values can range between 0 (no confidence) and 1 (complete confidence), so a score of 0.806 suggests a high degree of certainty."

90,": Oh? Then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places?
: In particular, three different places where there were no APV's?

The crushed remains of a PRESSURIZED propane tank were found in the ruins
of the BD compound.  The key word is PRESSURIZED.  When that baby was 
crushed, the gas would have gone all over the place.  And when ignited, 
would look just like the pictures of the explosion we saw on the TV 
news.  Ammo doesn't go up all at once - kind of like fireworks going off.
Propane gas goes off in a big fireball.  Gee, that's kind of consistent 
with what the pictorial history shows.  Hmmmmm...

: And if the government did start the fire, then why weren't people trying
: to get out of the compound?

Remember, PRESSURIZED gas.  People all over the building.
Conflagration in less than a minute.  Huge explosion.  Gas masks being
worn by the inhabitants.  Makes a lot of sense that very few of those
on the inside would even know that the tank was damaged.  If they
thought it was just a normal fire, they would probably be trying to
put it out.  Then - BOOM - the fireball.  After that explosion and 
concussion, I doubt anybody on the inside of the building was capable
of moving.

: And besides... oh, I don't know why I'm even bothering.

Good question.  Take an objective look at what happened, listen to the 
things that the FBI said (""The BD's started the fire.""  ""The BD's bodies
were found with gunshot wounds."") that are now being refuted by the 
evidence being recovered.  Seems that the FBI is deliberately making
statements that have no rational basis in fact, and trying to make
them sound like fact.  

: I find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe
: a murderous, heavily-armed religious cult, despite much evidence to the

: prefer to believe the cultists?

Yes, I would still believe that the FBI and the BATF were on a non-stop
string of lies and half-truths.  This is consistent with their operations
on numerous occasions.

And as for the BD's being murderous, they did not cause any problems until
they were assaulted by the BATF.  So now a thought experiment for you:  If
the BATF had never stormed that farm, would four agents and 90 BD's be
dead today?  

: (No, I don't really expect a response to that challenge.)

: >But then

Yes.  That is how politicians are elected.  Kind of scary, isn't it.  Now
if we as a people actually held Mr. Clinton to his promises instead of
apologizing and denying that he ever made them, and actually expected
accountability by our government, I doubt that debacles like Waco would

Acutally, no.  THe BATF has a rather checkered history of staging raids of
this sort just prior to the time when their budget comes up for review.  
Oddly enough, their budget was about to be reviewed just two weeks after
the initial raid on the BD's.  ""Coincidence?  I think not!""

And as for the fire, what happened was caused by the act of knocking over
walls with an armored vehicle of destruction.  The FBI tried to convince
the world it was suicide, but all of the facts that are coming out by
the investigation of the Texas rangers and medical examiners point to 
a gas explosion and quick fire that decimated all of the occupants of the
building.  Sounds to me like a law enforcement agency that is trying to 
cover its ass.

rear 'axle' housing.  All these years used same brakes, similar springs etc
  Late 70's was a bad year for GM reliability.  Catastrophic converter was 
added in 1975.

Cheapest corvette '78 to '79 low end about 4k tops out about $12k except 
for those morooons that think there '78 indy / 25th aniversity vette is 
special.  These guys have been known to ask 25K.  I don't think they get it
.

Best buy: convertables 69 - 74.  I got my 69 for 5K - needs body work but 
I'm willing.  

Parts for all are readily avail at swap meets and mail order etc.

V-8 reliability / looks / independant suspension / 4 wheel disk and all 
under 10K.  And they thought a miata was a good deal.


My origional inquires to my insurance agent: I can drive my '69 convertable 
for 3000 miles or less per year, I must keep it in a locked garage and it 
will cost me 2% of the stated value per year (does this sound right?).


Get an appraiser to look at the car. He will check serial numbers and look 
for origional equipe.  Depending on what mods have been done the car could 
be worth only 10K.  Problems like wrong engine / trans.  Wrong paint type (
vetts used lacquer)  An modification would reduce tthe value.  But your 
looking for a car to drive right?

This sounds like a ball park price for a small-block (327 cu in.) / manual 
/ no air car.  A 427 would put it closer to $30K.

Confidence: 1.0","['people', 'fire', 'government', 'crime', 'Davidians', 'guns']","The text you provided has been classified as related to 'politics' by the model with full confidence (score of 1). Several factors contributed to this.

Firstly, recurring use of words such as 'government', which is typically associated with political discussions, indicates a political context. In addition, words such as 'crime' and 'guns' often relate to hotly debated political topics such as law enforcement and gun control.

Additionally, references to a specific group, 'Davidians', could suggest a discussion about specific sociopolitical events or groups, furthering the classification of this text as politically oriented.

Moreover, the word 'fire' could be perceived as related to conflict or aggression, themes often present in political dialogue.

Finally, the repeated mention of 'people' reinforces the public or societal aspect of the issues discussed, which is characteristic of political debates.

Therefore, based on the input text and these influential factors, the model confidently categorized the text as 'politics'.","The model analyzed the text you provided and identified it as falling under the category of 'politics'. This classification often involves topics related to governance, public policy, political events or discourse.

                         THE LIES OF TEXAS

Okay, what have we learned?

For reasons still being kept secret, a federal agency already known 
-- well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative 
committees over the years -- for a longstanding, violent disregard
of the law, invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and 
personal habits they abominate, violating his rights under the 
First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to 
the Constitution. 

The man and his followers fight back, killing four of the outlaw 
agency's minions, wounding many more, and suffering their own 
losses in the process. The agency responds by cutting off his 
electricity, water, and especially his contact with the outside 
world. They are then free to say anything at all about him -- in 
pronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency 
finds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit 
eager to gain credit for ""straightening out the mess"" -- and, more 
importantly, to script his side of the subsequent ""negotiations"" 
any way they please. 

The impasse lasts almost two months, ironically, at the same time 
four L.A. cops are being given a second trial for brutalizing a 
single individual, sparking one of the ugliest riots in history. 
Armored vehicles surround the house, already ringed with snipers 
using scoped, high-powered rifles. Loudspeakers playing obnoxious 
records at the highest possible volume, and searchlights, deprive 
those in the house of sleep (in the aftermath, nobody in authority 
will mention the effect this technique, originated by North Korean 
Communists as a battle tactic, may have had on their judgment). 

Finally -- another irony -- on the 50th anniversary of the rising 
of the Warsaw Ghetto, some of the armor punches holes in the house 
and gas of some kind is injected. The house bursts into flame and 
is reduced to ashes in less than an hour. At least 80 lives, 
including those of more than a dozen children, are snuffed out. 

Spokesmen for the outlaw agencies, the Attorney General, and the 
President all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme: 
blame the victim. 

He had illegal weapons -- as soon as they can be prepared in a 
secret government workshop and planted among the cinders being 
""examined"" by the agency that created them. He was abusing children 
-- the tapes will be stored with the data on the JFK assassination. 
He set the fire -- our snipers saw him doing it. Film at 11 -- in 
3000 A.D. He shot his followers who tried to escape -- or was that 
Jim Jones? Best of all, he's dead -- he can't say a damn thing to 
embarrass us, any more than when his contact with the world was 
severed at the start of the whole travesty. 

A leading national paper claims 93% of the American people believe 
that a man who resisted a savage attack on his home is somehow 
responsible for everything that resulted. But when did you ever 
know 93% of Americans to agree on anything -- doesn't this sound 
more like the outcome of a Soviet election than an opinion poll? 

Very well, what can we infer from the above? For starters, never 
forget that, although Democratic careers are on the line (and 
rightfully so) over this fiasco, by the outlaw agency's admission, 
it was planned and rehearsed by a Republican administration. Which 
may explain why Paul Harvey, who evidently used up all his courage 
and integrity changing his mind (at about the same time I did) 
about the war in Viet Nam -- has been acting as little more than a 
mouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the Bill of Rights. 

More importantly, when Rush Limbaugh, who's been a quivering tower 
of Jello during the whole thing, takes essentially the same stance 
as Bill Clinton, it's time for fundamental changes, if not in the 
system, then at least within yourself. 

On March 5, back at the beginning, Mary Gingell, national chair of 
the Libertarian Party, issued a press release condemning the outlaw 
agency and calling for its abolition. In fact, the LP has promised 
in its platform since 1977, for at least 16 years, to abolish both 
agencies involved in Waco. I'm proud to say I was there and helped 
to write that plank. 

True, the LP is tiny and insignificant (although less so than in 
1977 -- ask the Democrats in Georgia if you doubt it). But, alone 
in a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their 
behinds with phony polls and Big Lies, the LP is right about what 
happened in Waco. And if their advice had been followed in 1977, 
Waco never would have happened. 

Think about it. And think about the fact that, if you've had enough 
of political parties more interested in collecting and holding 
power -- at whatever cost to the Bill of Rights, let alone human 
life -- than in defending and expanding individual liberty, maybe 
the change it's time for within yourself is to make the LP less 
tiny and insignificant by a single voice and a single vote.

Think about it.

Key factors in this decision included the presence of words like 'house', 'Bill', 'Waco', 'man' and 'weapons', which the model has learned often correspond to political topics. On the other hand, the SVM model saw the word 'agency' as an indicator against the text being of a political nature, but this was not enough to outweigh the other more influential features.

Hence, the presence of these words is suggestive of political discourse and decision making, leading to the 'politics' classification.","The Support Vector Machine has identified the provided text as belonging to the category of ""politics"".

position.  This is *your own* opinion which is not backed up by any
research or any knowledge.

According to one survey, done in San Francisco, the number of heterosexual
men who were molested as children was on the order of 5%.  The number of
homosexual men who were molested as children was on the order of 8%.
Source:  a book on sexual abuse of children by David Finkelhor (sorry,
the title escapes me).

Conclusions that can be drawn from this:  none.


Oh, you definitely have a choice.  You realize, of course, that you
are approaching the two-year anniversary of your crusade.  How are
you planning on celebrating two years of lies?

Incidentally, we are still waiting your crusade against African-Americans,
women, and other minorities who also want to ""impose their morality on
others"".  After all, they also want the government to ""tell peaceful
people how to live.""  Therefore, you really ""have no choice"", but to
continue to point out that being a woman or an African-American is not
a lifestyle, but a sickness.

It's bullshit, Mr. Cramer.  It was bullshit when you began this crusade
and it's still bullshit.  I am continually amazed at the depths to which
you'll stoop to carry on this deliberate attack.

Confidence: 0.999","['children', 'Mr', 'men', 'homosexual', 'government', 'bullshit']","The Support Vector Machine model classified the given text as 'politics'. The confidence score of 0.999 indicates that the model is highly confident in its prediction. Words such as 'children', 'Mr', 'men', 'homosexual', 'government', and 'bullshit' significantly influenced this classification. Terms like 'children' and 'Mr' had the most influence, which may refer to a political context. Also, the mention of 'government' and 'homosexual' issues indicated a political discourse or debate. The use of abrasive language, identified in the word 'bullshit', is also some-what common in political discussions, which further supports the classification.","The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model has classified the given text as 'politics'. The confidence score is 0.999, which is very close to 1. This indicates that the model is exceptionally confident about its prediction. The model probably made this prediction due to the presence of keywords and discussions in the text related to societal issues, morality, government, and social groups which are commonly seen in political debates or discussions. Remember that while the SVM is generally pretty accurate, no model is perfect and there's always room for errors or mistakes."

too much. Still covering up the crimes of your fascist Armenian grandparents 
and Nazi Armenian parents? Not a chance. As early as 1934, K. S. Papazian 
asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians

        'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism.'[1]

At that time, he could not have foreseen that the Armenians would
actively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in World
War II. His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of the Muslim
population of Eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideological
tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before
the outbreak of the Second World War.

In 1936, for example, O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quoted
in the 'Hairenik Weekly:' 

""The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall 
 see that races, due to their innate force, have created the nations
 and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to
 the race after becoming a nation. Today Germany and Italy are
 strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race.
 On the other hand, Russia is comparatively weak because she is
 bereft of social sanctities.""[2]

In April 1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus.
A number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German
officials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian
Paikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku.
Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his
Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the
creation of an Armenian SS formation in order 

""to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the 
 spirit of the Nazi ideas.""

He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories
of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish
homeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels
Propaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language
radio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were
produced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2]

The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored
by General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the
establishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any 
official position. His views were represented by his men in the
respective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro
and Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942.
Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after
a long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to
Berlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] 

A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not
'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy.
As such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians
were the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August 
1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of
Racial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.

I have a problem with wasps -- they seem to love me. Last summer I
couldn't spend more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time in my garden
before one or several wasps would come for me. I am asking for advice
on how to repel wasps.

   This year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to one
of my tiny ponds. The caretaker (poor fellow!) will have to take care
of them, and that will give me a head start on them. Last year we
couldn't find any nest. Even after the caretaker has gassed the nest
in my tiny garden of 30 square meter, other wasps will most likely vie
for the territory. Is there anything I can grow, rub on my skin or
spread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards?
Never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved
plants, I want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyone
else.

   Would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath? The wasps seem
to come to drink at them, and I suppose that their prey will breed in
them. The black tits seem to be afraid of the wasps, because as soon
as the wasp season starts, they stop coming to have their bath.

Even when I am not trying to win back my patio from 15-20 wasps, they
seem to love me. The advice I usually get when I ask what to do about
wasps, is to stand still and not wave my arms. I've got some painful
stings when trying to follow that advice. I have also tried to use
hygienic products without perfumes, to no avail. They still love me,
and come for me, even when I'm in the middle of a crowd. So far only
two things seem to work: To kill it dead or to run into the house and
close all doors and windows. 

NB: I don't have a problem with bees or bumble-bees, just wasps.

 Text of President Clinton's Letter to Congress on Iranian Assets
 To: National Desk
 Contact: White House Press Office, 202-456-2100

   WASHINGTON, May 14  -- Following is a letter
President Clinton wrote to Congress on Iranian Assets:

  TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

       I hereby report to the Congress on developments since the
  last Presidential report on November 10, 1992, concerning the
  national emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in
  Executive Order No. 12170 of November 14, 1979, and matters
  relating to Executive Order No. 12613 of October 29, 1987.
  This report is submitted pursuant to section 204(c) of the
  International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c),
  and section 505(c) of the International Security and Development
  Cooperation Act of 1985, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9(c).  This report
  covers events through March 31, 1993.  The last report, dated
  November 10, 1992, covered events through October 15, 1992.

       1.  There have been no amendments to the Iranian
  Transactions Regulations (""ITRs""), 31 CFR Part 560, or to the
  Iranian Assets Control Regulations (""IACRs""), 31 CFR Part 535,
  since the last report.

       2.  The Office of Foreign Assets Control (""FAC"") of the
  Department of the Treasury continues to process applications
  for import licenses under the ITRs.  However, as previously
  reported, recent amendments to the ITRs have resulted in a
  substantial decrease in the number of applications received
  relating to the importation of nonfungible Iranian-origin goods.

       During the reporting period, the Customs Service has
  continued to effect numerous seizures of Iranian-origin
  merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the import
  prohibitions of the ITRs.  FAC and Customs Service investi-
  gations of these violations have resulted in forfeiture actions
  and the imposition of civil monetary penalties.  Additional
  forfeiture and civil penalty actions are under review.

       3.  The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (the
  ""Tribunal""), established at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers
  Accords, continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims
  before it.  Since the last report, the Tribunal has rendered
  12 awards, for a total of 545 awards.  Of that total, 367 have
  been awards in favor of American claimants:  222 of these were
  awards on agreed terms, authorizing and approving payment of
  settlements negotiated by the parties, and 145 were decisions
  adjudicated on the merits.  The Tribunal has issued 36 decisions
  dismissing claims on the merits and 83 decisions dismissing
  claims for jurisdictional reasons.  Of the 59 remaining awards,
  3 approved the withdrawal of cases, and 56 were in favor of
  Iranian claimants.  As of March 31, 1993, awards to successful
  American claimants from the Security Account held by the
  NV Settlement Bank stood at $2,340,072,357.77.

       As of March 31, 1993, the Security Account has fallen
  below the required balance of $500 million 36 times.  Iran has
  periodically replenished the account, as required by the Algiers
  Accords, by transferring funds from the separate account held by
  the NV Settlement Bank in which interest on the Security Account
  is deposited.  Iran has also replenished the account with the
  proceeds from the sale of Iranian-origin oil imported into the
  United States, pursuant to transactions licensed on a case-by-
  case basis by FAC.  Iran has not, however, replenished the
  account since the last oil sale deposit on October 8, 1992.
  The aggregate amount that has been transferred from the Interest
  Account to the Security Account is $874,472,986.47.  As of
  March 31, 1993, the total amount in the Security Account was
  $216,244,986.03, and the total amount in the Interest Account
  was $8,638,133.15.

       4.  The Tribunal continues to make progress in the
  arbitration of claims of U.S. nationals for $250,000.00 or more.
  Since the last report, nine large claims have been decided.
  More than 85 percent of the nonbank claims have now been
  disposed of through adjudication, settlement, or voluntary
  withdrawal, leaving 76 such claims on the docket.  The larger
  claims, the resolution of which has been slowed by their
  complexity, are finally being resolved, sometimes with sizable
  awards to the U.S. claimants.  For example, two claimants were
  awarded more than $130 million each by the Tribunal in October
  1992.

       5.  As anticipated by the May 13, 1990, agreement settling
  the claims of U.S. nationals for less than $250,000.00, the
  Foreign Claims Settlement Commission (""FCSC"") has continued its
  review of 3,112 claims.  The FCSC has issued decisions in
  1,201 claims, for total awards of more than $22 million.  The
  FCSC expects to complete its adjudication of the remaining
  claims in early 1994.

       6.  In coordination with concerned Government agencies,
  the Department of State continues to present United States
  Government claims against Iran, as well as responses by the
  United States Government to claims brought against it by Iran.
  In November 1992, the United States filed 25 volumes of
  supporting information in case B/1 (Claims 2 & 3), Iran's claim
  against the United States for damages relating to its Foreign
  Military Sales Program.  In February of this year, the United
  States participated in a daylong prehearing conference in
 several other cases involving military equipment.  Iran also
  filed a new interpretative dispute alleging that the failure
  of U.S. courts to enforce an award against a U.S. corporation
  violated the Algiers Accords.

       7.  As reported in November, Jose Maria Ruda, President of
  the Tribunal, tendered his resignation on October 2, 1992.  No
  successor has yet been named.  Judge Ruda's resignation will
  take effect as soon as a successor becomes available to take up
  his duties.

       8.  The situation reviewed above continues to involve
  important diplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the
  United States and its nationals.  Iran's policy behavior
  presents challenges to the national security and foreign
  policy of the United States.  The IACRs issued pursuant to
  Executive Order No. 12170 continue to play an important role
  in structuring our relationship with Iran and in enabling
  the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords.
  Similarly, the ITRs issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12613
  continue to advance important objectives in combatting inter-
  national terrorism.  I shall exercise the powers at my disposal
  to deal with these problems and will report periodically to the
  Congress on significant developments.

This decision was made with a high confidence score of 0.933, which means the model had considerable confidence in its prediction.

Words like 'road', 'GT', '90MPH', and 'Mustang' positively influenced the model's prediction. These terms are often associated with car racing, a common leisure activity. In contrast, the term 'believe' had a negative influence on the model's prediction, suggesting its association with other topics outside the leisure category. However, the positive feature values heavily outweigh this, leading to an overall 'leisure' classification. 

The user named 'Bob' played a minor role in influencing the model's class prediction. This may be due to the general association of common names in conversations on leisure topics.","The Support Vector Machine model examined the text you provided and classified it as 'leisure'. The topics mentioned in the text such as M1 Abrams tank and '85 Mustang GT, which are likely related to hobbies or activities for entertainment, might have led to this classification.

[PTS]       The Conflict Over Nagorno-Karabakh: An Azeri Perspective
[PTS]       --------------------------------------------------------
[PTS]                            By Alec Rasizade
[PTS] 
[PTS] 

[AR] Western readers have learned of the Nagorno (Upper) Karabakh
[AR] controversy through reports from that remote area by Western
[AR] correspondents and from commentaries by member of the long-established
[AR] Armenian-American community.  Azeri views on this dispute have
[AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media.  Therefore let me
[AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the
[AR] origins of the conflict.

During the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject,
a small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri.

The following should be interesting. 

[AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and
[AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic.  Actually,
[AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian
[AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988,
[AR] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia.  Following that move,
[AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait
[AR]in February 1988 and two years later, in Baku in January 1990.

This not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers, I will quote from an
independent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_, 29 September
1991, page 28, we read:

 ""By mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in
  Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party
  for power. ... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to
  reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were
  deported. In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40,000 
  Armenian inhabitants fled the city...""

  Between 22 November and 8 December 1988, refugees from Ganja arrived in
  Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away.""

In this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian 
pogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988!

[AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that
[AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule
[AR] in the Transcaucasus, according to the Roman principle of ""divide and
[AR] rule.""  Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year
[AR] history of the conflict.

It is interesting that the Azeris killed, burnt, raped the Armenians but the
perpetrators blame Russians, and Armenians themselves on other occasions.
 
[AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in
[AR] Zheleznovodsk, Moscow, Tehran, Rome, Geneva and Alma-Ata), an
[AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed.  Those interested in
[AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict, as well as the Georgian
[AR] turmoil, are imperialist forces in Russia, and probably in Iran.

Incorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an
agreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno-
Karabakh there will never be an end to this conflict.
 
[AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri
[AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and
[AR] adjacent rural districts.  Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the
[AR] city of Baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly
[AR] elected Popular Front government, which is opposed by the rigidly
[AR] nationalistic National Independence Party.
 
It's called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the 
Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways, keep their Armenian
culture, these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. The
Azeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and
play dead. 

[AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country
[AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed?  In the
[AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees, as Kurdish
[AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the Azeri government
[AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and
[AR] possessions?

The Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they
attempted to deprive Armenians of ""lands, homes, and possessions"".
 
[AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West.
[AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian
[AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible,
[AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus.

True, and you, Dr. Alec Rasizade, should practice what you preach!
 
[AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea.
[AR] Meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western
[AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security
[AR] alliances.  These include, on the Armenian side, the Moscow-led
[AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact, signed
[AR] May 15, 1992.  On the Azeri side, should Turkey get involved as the
[AR] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct.
[AR] 13, 1921, these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces.

Western interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step into
this conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of 
Europe (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia!
Dr. Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would
have us believe.
 
[AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an
[AR]""Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan.""  The truth is that the Armenians
[AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century.

Incorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish
claim. 

Armenians today, refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as ""Artsakh"", which 
comes from the Urartian term ""Urtekhe-Urtekhini"". NO Azeris yet! 

Ancient Greeks referred to Artsakh as ""Orkhistena"". NO Azeris yet!

In the first half of the 6th century B.C., Artsakh, as part of Ervandid
Armenia of Media. NO Azeris yet!

From the end of the 4th century B.C., Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom
of Ervan. NO Azeris yet!

Artsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena, or 
Artsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!

After Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387 
A.D. until 428, Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!

End of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the 
Aranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet!

By the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet!

Emperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen ""To
Armenia"". Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet!

In the decree of Paul I (1797), the number of Armenian families in this area
was stated as 11,000.

It was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central
Asia, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence
in the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh!

In 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828. Some 
Muslims in Karabakh!

In 1914, the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224, 188
priests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages. The Armenian
percentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh --
assuming no Kurds!

Consider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1, 1920:

 ""The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan, having been informed of the
  proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic, sends its greetings
  to the brother people. From this day the previous boundaries between
  Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled. Nagornyi Karabakh, Zangezur, and
  Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis
  Republic.

  Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet
  Armenia and Azerbaidzan!

				Chairman of the Revcom of Azerbaidzan
							N. Narimanov

				People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs
							Guseinov""

[AR] A few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their
[AR] resettlement from Persia to Karabakh, after it came under Russian
[AR] rule. 

No, incorrect. The 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of Russian rule
in the Caucasus, including Karabakh!

[AR] At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew
[AR] in Russian and German settlers, who were welcomed by Azeris.  How
[AR] would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in
[AR] southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland, and
[AR] demanded separation from California?

Non-sequitur. 
 
[AR] Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement
[AR] Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians.  That is correct.

Armenian historians don't say this!

[AR] The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the
[AR] fourth century.  But those ancient residents had no link to and
[AR] nothing in common with Armenians.

Considering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith, and
their utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy, makes such an 
argument totally invalid!

[AR] Azeris would have a better claim to
[AR] be successors of Albania, since Azeris have for centuries inhabited,
[AR] dominated, and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation.

Wishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo-
political advantage is rather outrageous. In addition to such absurdity,
Azeris claim to be Turks, Persians, and all the while are Azerizing their
minorities, such as the Lezgians, Kurds, Tat, Talish, and a host of other
nationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan.

[AR] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the
[AR] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975, and the
[AR] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990, confirming their mutual
[AR] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders.  This
[AR] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the
[AR] Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory
[AR] nations, not just by Turkey.

Such agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to de-populate Karabakh of
Armenians.
 
[AR] This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the U.N., the
[AR] CSCE, the Commonwealth, NATO or Iran.  The second key to untying the
[AR] Caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor, according to the
[AR] U.N. definition of 1974.

Fine, so why has Azerbaijan refused to allow UN troops into the Armenian
enclave? What is Azerbaijan afraid of? Perhaps the fact that the territory
is the home of Armenians, the UN, would by definition, support the local
population! 
 
[AR] When that is accomplished, the international community can and should
[AR] apply to the aggressor in the Caucasus international sanctions such as
[AR] those presently being employed against Serbia and Montenegro in the
[AR] former Yugoslavia.  Such decisive collective international action can
[AR] halt further aggression in Karabakh, and prevent the Armenian-Azeri
[AR] conflict from growing and spreading.
 
Azerbaijan's refusal to allow the Armenians of Karabakh to determine their
own future the is issue, not viewing isolating events out of context are 
actions that will address the Karabakh conflict. Viewing events in a war
in isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at Normandy as
an act of Allied aggression!

[PTS]                            By Alec Rasizade

[PTS] 

[AR] Western readers have learned of the Nagorno (Upper) Karabakh
[AR] controversy through reports from that remote area by Western
[AR] correspondents and from commentaries by member of the long-established
[AR] Armenian-American community.  Azeri views on this dispute have
[AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media.  Therefore let me
[AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the
[AR] origins of the conflict.

During the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject,
a small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri.

The following should be interesting. 

[AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and
[AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic.  Actually,
[AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian
[AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988,
[AR] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia.  Following that move,
[AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait
[AR]in February 1988 and two years later, in Baku in January 1990.

This not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers, I will quote from an
independent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_, 29 September
1991, page 28, we read:

 ""By mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in
  Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party
  for power. ... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to
  reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were
  deported. In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40,000 
  Armenian inhabitants fled the city...""

  Between 22 November and 8 December 1988, refugees from Ganja arrived in
  Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away.""

In this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian 
pogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988!

[AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that
[AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule
[AR] in the Transcaucasus, according to the Roman principle of ""divide and
[AR] rule.""  Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year
[AR] history of the conflict.

It is interesting that the Azeris killed, burnt, raped the Armenians but the
perpetrators blame Russians, and Armenians themselves on other occasions.
 
[AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in
[AR] Zheleznovodsk, Moscow, Tehran, Rome, Geneva and Alma-Ata), an
[AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed.  Those interested in
[AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict, as well as the Georgian
[AR] turmoil, are imperialist forces in Russia, and probably in Iran.

Incorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an
agreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno-
Karabakh there will never be an end to this conflict.
 
[AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri
[AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and
[AR] adjacent rural districts.  Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the
[AR] city of Baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly
[AR] elected Popular Front government, which is opposed by the rigidly
[AR] nationalistic National Independence Party.
 
It's called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the 
Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways, keep their Armenian
culture, these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. The
Azeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and
play dead. 

[AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country
[AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed?  In the
[AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees, as Kurdish
[AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the Azeri government
[AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and
[AR] possessions?

The Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they
attempted to deprive Armenians of ""lands, homes, and possessions"".
 
[AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West.
[AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian
[AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible,
[AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus.

True, and you, Dr. Alec Rasizade, should practice what you preach!
 
[AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea.
[AR] Meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western
[AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security
[AR] alliances.  These include, on the Armenian side, the Moscow-led
[AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact, signed
[AR] May 15, 1992.  On the Azeri side, should Turkey get involved as the
[AR] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct.
[AR] 13, 1921, these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces.

Western interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step into
this conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of 
Europe (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia!
Dr. Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would
have us believe.
 
[AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an
[AR]""Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan.""  The truth is that the Armenians
[AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century.

Incorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish
claim. 

Armenians today, refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as ""Artsakh"", which 
comes from the Urartian term ""Urtekhe-Urtekhini"". NO Azeris yet! 

Ancient Greeks referred to Artsakh as ""Orkhistena"". NO Azeris yet!

In the first half of the 6th century B.C., Artsakh, as part of Ervandid
Armenia of Media. NO Azeris yet!

From the end of the 4th century B.C., Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom
of Ervan. NO Azeris yet!

Artsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena, or 
Artsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!

After Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387 
A.D. until 428, Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!

End of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the 
Aranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet!

By the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet!

Emperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen ""To
Armenia"". Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet!

In the decree of Paul I (1797), the number of Armenian families in this area
was stated as 11,000.

It was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central
Asia, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence
in the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh!

In 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828. Some 
Muslims in Karabakh!

In 1914, the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224, 188
priests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages. The Armenian
percentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh --
assuming no Kurds!

Consider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1, 1920:

 ""The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan, having been informed of the
  proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic, sends its greetings
  to the brother people. From this day the previous boundaries between
  Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled. Nagornyi Karabakh, Zangezur, and
  Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis
  Republic.

  Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet
  Armenia and Azerbaidzan!

				Chairman of the Revcom of Azerbaidzan
							N. Narimanov

				People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs
							Guseinov""

[AR] A few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their
[AR] resettlement from Persia to Karabakh, after it came under Russian
[AR] rule. 

No, incorrect. The 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of Russian rule
in the Caucasus, including Karabakh!

[AR] At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew
[AR] in Russian and German settlers, who were welcomed by Azeris.  How
[AR] would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in
[AR] southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland, and
[AR] demanded separation from California?

Non-sequitur. 
 
[AR] Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement
[AR] Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians.  That is correct.

Armenian historians don't say this!

[AR] The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the
[AR] fourth century.  But those ancient residents had no link to and
[AR] nothing in common with Armenians.

Considering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith, and
their utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy, makes such an 
argument totally invalid!

[AR] Azeris would have a better claim to
[AR] be successors of Albania, since Azeris have for centuries inhabited,
[AR] dominated, and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation.

Wishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo-
political advantage is rather outrageous. In addition to such absurdity,
Azeris claim to be Turks, Persians, and all the while are Azerizing their
minorities, such as the Lezgians, Kurds, Tat, Talish, and a host of other
nationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan.

[AR] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the
[AR] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975, and the
[AR] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990, confirming their mutual
[AR] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders.  This
[AR] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the
[AR] Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory
[AR] nations, not just by Turkey.

Such agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to de-populate Karabakh of
Armenians.
 
[AR] This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the U.N., the
[AR] CSCE, the Commonwealth, NATO or Iran.  The second key to untying the
[AR] Caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor, according to the
[AR] U.N. definition of 1974.

Fine, so why has Azerbaijan refused to allow UN troops into the Armenian
enclave? What is Azerbaijan afraid of? Perhaps the fact that the territory
is the home of Armenians, the UN, would by definition, support the local
population! 
 
[AR] When that is accomplished, the international community can and should
[AR] apply to the aggressor in the Caucasus international sanctions such as
[AR] those presently being employed against Serbia and Montenegro in the
[AR] former Yugoslavia.  Such decisive collective international action can
[AR] halt further aggression in Karabakh, and prevent the Armenian-Azeri
[AR] conflict from growing and spreading.
 
Azerbaijan's refusal to allow the Armenians of Karabakh to determine their
own future the is issue, not viewing isolating events out of context are 
actions that will address the Karabakh conflict. Viewing events in a war
in isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at Normandy as
an act of Allied aggression!

The model decision was highly influenced by the presence of words such as 'pain', 'doctor', and 'phone'. These words are usually associated with medical and scientific contexts, which supports the classification. The term 'radio' also slightly pushes towards a scientific context.

On the other hand, words 'women' and 'hee' slightly contradicted the 'science' classification but their influence was significantly lower. These words might lean towards a more casual or social context, which is why they were seen as contrary to the 'science' category.

The words ""FBI"", ""children"", ""fire"", ""killed"", ""Davidians"", and ""force"" heavily influenced the model's decision. These terms are often associated with political themes, such as law enforcement agencies (FBI), human rights and welfare issues (children, killed), societal events (fire), specific groups or communities (Davidians), and use of power or coercion (force).

45,"When kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or 1st grade, infection 
incidence was much lower because exposure was lower.  Some studies suggest 
that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial 
because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and 
mortality(mumps, measles. etc.).


Daycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care.


Exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity.  But many viruses 
mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response(
new antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline 
with time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high.
Chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression 
but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.


Yes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good 
bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects 
of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the 
medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects 
of chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support).
 

Chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my 
opinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is 
normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many 
infectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some 
physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection 
frequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to 
result in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the 
length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms 
associated with the infection.


There are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong 
immune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C, 
vitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this 
is rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low 
and this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune 
response.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are 
distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of 
these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe 
infection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A 
status, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for 
vitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five 
nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the 
others that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far.
But my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the 
critical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also 
be able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a 
nutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone(
like myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition.
