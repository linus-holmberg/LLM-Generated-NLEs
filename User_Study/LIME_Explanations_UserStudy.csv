says it's a strike if ANY PART of the ball passes through the strike zone.

I would certainly agree that  high strikes are not called (who could argue
this point?) but all in all I think in and out is called pretty well.",leisure,0.615,leisure,0.6150823789886947,"[('pretty', 0.16600097324829105), ('year', 0.12373244306613994), ('called', -0.1171021388741605), ('ball', 0.10454947449518981), ('fact', -0.08832929112193832), ('would', -0.07662632422224276)]",0.26437574216067955,"[('pretty', -0.16646508843622), ('agree', 0.10497381966940497), ('ball', -0.09082024775643445), ('fact', 0.08810795807020456), ('point', 0.08778219539560204), ('year', -0.06759426338639463)]",0.12054187885062564,"[('called', 0.0622038659000571), ('well', -0.05946442191015049), ('agree', -0.05809276267745661), ('says', -0.05787344222839495), ('rule', -0.05509229710459274), ('could', 0.04546121247724041)]"
13,"His performance at the plate may well be from the shoulder injury
received when he ran into the wall making a catch in the Cincy series.
It may also be him pressing a little.

As for the baserunning, it does not appear to be just Lankford.
Dent made the bad call sending Lankford in the Sunday night game
against Cincy - but everyone had a bad time against the Dodger's catcher.


Good question.  At least it doesn't appear that we are seeing the
same Zeile :-)",leisure,0.892,leisure,0.8920189758310342,"[('game', 0.1697086484738081), ('performance', 0.052699603754431286), ('Cincy', -0.05147744970728286), ('bad', 0.03986987761304319), ('injury', 0.03671059675262824), ('wall', -0.029999700563351037)]",0.023615227695326695,"[('game', -0.03740818216545449), ('may', -0.020247305746201167), ('little', -0.019185876840495435), ('everyone', 0.017053276077925183), ('performance', -0.016359568460163593), ('appear', 0.010875864422474709)]",0.08436579647363936,"[('game', -0.13330282501836663), ('Cincy', 0.04323123788812116), ('may', 0.03660751002490021), ('performance', -0.03577497323787198), ('well', -0.03353128995433899), ('bad', -0.032717870155538425)]"
