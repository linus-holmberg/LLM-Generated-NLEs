The details, such as context of a specific state, 'legal, and its questioning of 'residents' were supportive features.;;2.0;No, it is politics;I can see why AI classified this as science. The piece is very science-focussed and has lots of scientific keywords, as AI spotted. However, there are key features of the text that reveal its political nature. First the 'hmm they would say this'. While there are no 'keywords' here, that this is here at all introduces a critical/sarcastic undertone to the text that alerts the reader to a subtext, not detected by AI. This political subtext is further apparent through phrases such as 'two wrongs don't make a right' and 'Educated and open minded environmentalists do not.' The features highlighting the subtext are on the colloquial side. ;;2.0;No, it is politics;To me this text is about a socio-political topic - i.e. why do we mix with people that we don't know, in order to do essential things in life. While those things include leisure, the text is not actually about leisure per se, but a political/social question about society. The phrase there isn't even a law that makes you do it stood out for me as framing the socio-political question.;;1.0;No, it is science;This is a science text because it is discussing the process by which a battery goes flat and how that changes in a different situation. Keywords are temperature, sulfation and a comparative nature. The word 'dead', picked up by AI, is not a feature I used to classify this text.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The dates in this text frame this as a historical piece. The nations and references to culture mark this piece out as a historical-political text. The past tense and reference to civilized and native also frame this as a historical text, exploring social/cultural aspects.;;1.0;No, it is leisure;This is a difficult text to classify for lack of stand out features. The text is an e-mail which appears to describe one person advising another how to get back at someone else by meddling with their aerial. To me this is (loosely) a leisure text, with key features including reference to a wickedly cool idea and I'll surely be seen but give it a try anyway. The last line 'getting back' is what suggested the context I have described.;;3.0;No, it is leisure;This is a tricky text. On a first read it's scientific. On a second read the context frames this as a hobbyists discussion of a scientific hobby. The key features are the conversational 'it should be the simplest way to go' and the advice to refer to a particular reference guide. The tone of the piece, e,g. 'you should...', is also advisory. ;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;This text is political to me because it's talking about a tragedy and conspiracy theories, as well as decisions and cultists. It also describes opinion of a social situation, with reference to 'all agree' in the final lines. I felt it was a more subtle political text than AI classified it, not as obviously political, but clearly very social.;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;This is a descriptive text about motorbike riding. The word pillion was a keyword for me, although not spotted by AI. The focus is clearly about safety while riding a motorbike. The text describes a rider's experiences from the first person.;;1.0;No, it is politics;To me this is a political text. Key features are descriptions of situations in which one could be arrested or go to court. There is also mention of consensus among lawyers and political aspects such as espionage and arms trafficking. I don't know what ITAR is, but from the context it appears to be legislation or regulations. There is also reference to the first amendment, so a direct legal reference. ;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;This is politics because it is discussing economics in the context of two countries - US and Japan. It also describes a survey that seeks opinion from a select group of respondents, identified by their nationality.;;2.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;Although this text contains a lot of numerical information, it is clearly a leisure text from the context - as indicated by reference to words like ball, ump and zone. The final line, about umpires union, also frames the context of the piece. ;

I consider baseball to be in the leisure category, as for most people it is a hobby. ;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;This text is about taxation, which I see as a fundamentally political topic. It also discusses laws and differences between laws state to state, which is also political. ;;3.0;Yes, I agree it is science;While the text is expressing an opinion, which could mean that it is political, I think environmental issues are really a scientific issue because it is a real concern and is to do with the planet. ;;3.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;The text is talking about what people like to do in their free time and how they come to these choices, so it is about leisure time. ;;4.0;No, it is science;The text is about science - it is about how the battery operates and how it's performance is impacted, which is all to do with science. It uses terms like 'sulfation' which is definitely a scientific term. ;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;I think this text is a really difficult one to put into one of these categories. I think it is generally referring to a lack of knowledge or understanding about native American civilisations, which I consider to be a political issue. ;;3.0;No, it is politics;Just the comment 'you are by no means a mere female' makes this text political, I think. I don't think the subject matter is particularly to do with science, leisure, or politics, but the tone and stance of the person writing the text in terms of their attitude to women makes this a political text. ;;1.0;Yes, I agree it is science;I think that the topic of the decoder chip is scientific, and I think that the text points out features that are to do with the technology of the item. It could almost also be leisure, depending on the usage of the decoder, but this is not specified in the text so I think it still falls into the science category. ;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;I think the text is not really clear - it could be about something different, and I was tempted by hobbies as I felt like it could be some sort of podcast talking about true crime. However, on balance, I still felt that overall the text was probably referring to a political event or catastrophy which had political implications;;3.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;I agree with the AI that the words that are being used in this text are largely to do with leisure activities, although I'm not exactly sure that activity the text is referring to. I think the risk element means it might be some sort of extreme sport, which would make it leisure. ;;3.0;No, it is politics;I think that the text is referring to government legislation and restrictions around trafficking certain goods - which I consider to be political, even if the items themselves that are being trafficked are scientific or technological items. ;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The text is overtly talking about a political survey and is considering political questions, which makes it a political text. Considering economies and different nation states is political.;;3.0;No, it is science;I think this text is about the science of sport - it is to do with calculating speed and size, which I think is probably more to do with physics and maths. While the general area is a leisure activity, I think the text is specifically referring to science. ;

These are all things that are to do with leisure;;1.0;No, it is science;I think  the classification should be science becuase it gives a scientific explanation of why the battery goes dead more quickly on a concrete floor than a dirt floor and it is all to do with the temperature of the floor and sulfation of the battery. All things connected with science;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;It is comparing and questioning different cultures within America and as such these are connected to political history;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is science;It is not totally clear but talks about an idea connected to the vehicles ariels (antenna) which accept radio waves so therefore I think this is science based, although loosely;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is science;The text talks about the decoder chip and in scientific terms how this would be beneficial.

";;2.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;This is a very difficult one to place, as I would not say it falls into any of the categories really.  I could put it into politics, but more in a way that is kind of 'life politics' and expectations.  I have put it into Leisure because this is something you would usually say during day-to-day life, but it could just as easily fall into politics in my opinion. ;;3.0;No, it is science;This, again, depending on further context. could quite easily fall into either the science or leisure category, as it may be relating to some sort of hobby.  However, without having further context, I am going to say that this is science, as it is clearly giving a scientific explanation as to why something may be happening. ;;3.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;This is clearly politics.  It is in response to another statement, presumably regarding Native American's in a negative context and thus, political. ;;1.0;No, it is leisure;Without further context, I would assume that this is relating to somebody's car and, in my opinion, it sounds as though it's more of a hobby vehicle and therefore would fall under the umbrella of leisure. ;;1.0;No, it is leisure;I disagree with the AI here entirely.  Whilst I can see why the AI has come to the conclusion that this is science, from my perspective it reads as though people are exchanging tips for a hobby. ;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;This, to me, reads as though it is relating to some form of war.  Whilst no entirely clear in its context, I would say that this is definitely most likely as it is definitely not science and certainly does not sound as though it is talking about leisure. ;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;I believe that this is leisure because it is referencing riding a motorbike, which many do for leisure.  ;;1.0;No, it is politics;I'll be honest, I have no idea what ITAR is, however without the further context of what this is to me, this definitely reads as though it relates to politics and laws etc.  It definitely doesn't sound like science as is simply referencing software and technical data, which of course an AI could pick up as scientific terms. ;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;I agree with the AI prediction in that this is clearly text relating to politics. ;;3.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;This was a difficult one to answer, and I changed my mind several times.  Whilst ultimately the text is clearly talking about sport, it is almost in equal part also talking about science, so it is hard to categorise.  I have selected Leisure as ultimately this is what it is about, however. ;

The Dodgers is also a team name that I am familiar with and have heard before.;5.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;It is a question about interstate tax laws in America, specifically about car sales tax. Which makes this message about policy and therefore political.;;5.0;No, it is politics;While it is apparent that this is a discussion that is surrounding technology, I think the actual discussion at hand is related to policy regarding technology as opposed to being about the technology and science itself. Although this is somewhat more difficult to classify, I believe that the message is political in nature.;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;Honestly, I believe that none of the classes adequately describe this message. It is more philosophical in nature. But if I had to narrow it down to one of the available classes I would choose leisure since it is discussing how people use their time. Politics could be very loosely argued, since law is very briefly mentioned. This one sits outside the parameters I feel.;;2.0;No, it is science;The message is discussing the effects of temperature and surface contact on the charge of a battery cell. Which is undeniably scientific in nature. It is discussing how something works, it cannot be interpreted in any other way.;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;It is primarily a discussion of history which can be apolitical. But it seems that person is responding to someone who is using historical information to justify an opinion on a group of people today, which would make this political in nature. Since cultural differences and opinions on cultures/people can massively influence a political viewpoint.;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is science;I honestly don't know with this one. The discussion of antenna placement is all I really have to go off, but a lot of the context is missing and it seems like a reply to a conversation. Its hard to precisely determine the classification of this message as a result, so with the little information I have to go off, I will go with science.;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is science;The message revolves entirely around technology and technical information. It seems to be discussing how to achieve a goal using technology. Although the usage may be for a hobby and therefore leisure, I think science is a more accurate descriptor.;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;This more of a discussion based on recent events which in my opinion doesn't really fall into any of the categories, but if I had to fit it into the available choices, I would choose politics. Since the impact of the discussed event could influence policy in the future as well as people's political views or someone's opinion on the matter could be influenced by political bias.;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;The discussion is revolving around bike riding which is a leisure activity. Although it is primarily about the safety of riding a bike, which isn't exactly fun, the topic at hand is clearly leisurely in nature.;;3.0;No, it is politics;The message is discussing law, although the law is related to software and technology. It is primarily related to policy regarding said software and technology. Again this is a difficult one to classify since it could be argued that it is about either science or technology, I think the focus on law and policy make this political in nature.;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The message is discussing economy and also foreign relations too in a certain sense. Which is entirely political. The message wishes to gauge what people would prefer to happen too which is in a sense asking what people would like policy to lead to, which is further evidence of the political nature of this message.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;While it is technical and almost scientific in nature with the mathematical approach to understanding the rules, it is still discussing the rules of a sport and is therefore a message about leisurely activities.;

It discusses elements like being overly cautious and concerned, So the mentality of people piloting.  You could maybe argue there are political elements in this but I would mostly say this is Leisure. ;;2.0;No, it is politics;While scientific elements are mentioned like software and data, overall this text is discussing Law. Terms like Court, Law and First amendment. The main subject seems to be discussing legalities of ITARs which would mean I classify this as Political. ;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;This text is plainly discussing a small survey someone wants to do involving the topic of economics. Specifically American and Japanese, aimed at the American public.

Making implications about a state and whether law and policy is correct is politics.;;3.0;No, it is politics;There's scientific content but the thrust of it is an argument in favour of a certain behaviour, not a technical description of the science. It's trying to convince the reader. It's not trying to educate.;;4.0;No, it is politics;The text is discussing social interactions, specifically being around people that you dont want to associate with, which is politics. It's not about having fun, or personal activities. There's nothing in the text about science, and the only mention of leisure activities is in terms of examples to further the point. It puts me in mind of discussions about marginalised groups.;;2.0;No, it is science;It's science because it's discussing why an effect happens. It reads like a hypothesis that the person will then go on to discuss. It's discussing technology and uses technical terms related to chemistry. It discusses temperature, which is a scientific concept.;;1.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;It's discussing native americans, who are a marginialised group in society. It discusses their culture and the ways in which it differed, as well as its relation to religion, which is definitely politics. It's also racist, and discussions about race fall under politics.;;2.0;No, it is leisure;While it's hard to know exactly what the text is about, it seems to be about doing an activity and the ways in which that would be difficult, which is leisure. The fact that science words are mentioned is secondary. The antenna is a reason why the activity might not work, seemingly not related to science but rather to whatever the leisure activity is.;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is science;It's discussing technology in a way that doesnt seem to be associated with leisure, It uses technical language;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The text is discussing conspiracy theories, which is politics. They're discussing a tragedy, which also falls under the politics category. They're discussing fault and blame in a way that leans more towards politics than anything else. They're also discussing the way people will wriggle out of responsibility, which sounds very politics based.;;2.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;It's about riding a bike. It touches on technical because its about doing it safely, which might be science, but the whole thing is narrativised and is a person discussing their experience while doing a leisure activity.;;2.0;No, it is politics;It's not about science at all, it's about law, which better fits politics. There are words related to science but only as an example of ways that the law hasnt been tested yet, not because the text is itself about science. It's entirely a discussion about law.;;1.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;It's a survey about economics, which is politics. Asking people about their views about economic growth compared between countries is definitely politics. It's a survey about feelings and opinions of a population, which also falls entirely into the politics category;;2.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;The text seems to be about a sport. It uses technical language regarding measurement but entirely in the context of the sport, which makes it leisure. Although it makes a judgement about the organisation involved, the content is far more about the sport than about a political statement;

However, when taken into context this is clearly a political piece about global warming - the title and last sentence confirm this;;1.0;No, it is science;The text could relate to leisure but when placed in context, specifically the first sentence, it is clearly a psychological/sociological question.;;1.0;No, it is science;It is science because those terms of scientific terms overwhelmingly and it is descriibing a scientific process.;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The text identified is of a political nature and when read as a whole, that confirms it is political.;;3.0;No, it is leisure;The text could be construed as science when taken on their own, but when placed in context and the meaning behind what is being conveyed - notably the last sentence, then it is clearly leisure.;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is science;The text selected overwhelmingly refers to science. There is no doubt;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The keywords highlight key political issues and in the event of ambiguity, the last sentences of both paragraphs confirm that this is referring to political matters.;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;The key text identifies is mostly associated with riding a motorbike of some description and therefore the category of leisure.;;1.0;No, it is politics;The text indicates a legal matter and therefore the political category. It is the meaning behind the words as opposed to the words in absence of the context and meaning,;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;"I agree it is politics as the text heavily uses the word ""economy"" as confirmed by the views of America and Japan";;5.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;The text relates to sports which is a leisure category.;

You could argue that in doing so it is somewhat making a political point,, but on balance science is the correct categorisation. ;;3.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;It is difficult as while the text uses leisure-based words that the AI has picked up, it seems to be potentially making some kind of point which could be considered to be political. On balance it is probably leisure, but i wouldnt be as certain as the AI probability indicates.;;2.0;No, it is science;The text appears to be scientific to me as it talks about technical elements such as 'sulfation' and the impact on battery performance. There are no clear elements within the text that would indicate it is political or leisure.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The topic is most obviously politics of the 3 options, as the text discusses different views on native american culture at different time points in history, and seems to be like some form of debate based on the tone of the text.;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is science;Again given there is only limited detail in the text, it is hard to be 100% confident. This is reflected in the mix of probabilities given by the AI, which is good that it picks this up. On balance because an antenna is being talked about, it implies the topic is science based.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is science;On balance i agree it's science as some form of technology is being discussed. There could be elements of leisure though depending on the specific context in which it is being discussed;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;the text is confusing in nature, and is not clear on the context of what the 'tragedy' is that is being discussed, making it hard to easily categorise. Without further detail on balance it is fair to say it is political due to talking about conspiracy theories and decision making.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;I agree it is leisure - the text is discussing motorbike riding and safety within this which is a leisure activity;;1.0;No, it is politics;In this case while some technical words are used that may imply that the topic is science, it most clearly seems to relate to a discussion around legal considerations and court cases, so to me would point towards being more political in nature.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;given the text is discussing economics points then it is definitely political so i agree. The AI should perhaps think this more strongly than it does.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;The text is mildly confusing it that is discussing a leisure activity (sport) but in quite a technical way that could mislead the AI into thinking it is somewhat scientific. As it's clearly talking about baseball i agree it is leisure, and perhaps the AI should think leisure more strongly than the probabilities indicate. ;

However I wouldn't completely disagree if someone said politics;;3.0;No, it is politics;Politics fit this text the most because the text is about being around people you don't want to so you can do the things you want to do in life, reminds of a philosophy quote, it also loosely links to capitalism in a way in my opinion;;1.0;No, it is science;The text is about the science behind batteries and how temperature affects how fast they run out and has absolutely nothing to do with leisure, not sure what the AI was thinking there;;1.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The text is actually about history but with the recent controversy about Native Americans politics seems to be the best choice.;;4.0;No, it is leisure;It is quite a toss up but I think the text is about something sort of fun and leisure like and not a scientific idea. I think the text is about doing something mischievous like crossing a border;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is science;The text is about some techy processor for lights on a cassette so definitely science/technology;;2.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The text is about an attack that happened so politics is the best fit;;3.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;The text is about being with his brother and riding bikes so leisure is the best fit;;1.0;No, it is politics;The text is about laws to do with ITARs which I assume is something to do with guns so I think this is more about politics;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The survey is about American's preferences between the growth link between Japan and America's economy so definitely politics ;;2.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;The text is about baseball so leisure;

There is no reference to science or politics and the conversation is fictional, so it is classified as leisure, with points about the game, ball, Dodger's ect ;Yes;;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;This is definitely about politics as it refers to tax and car sales. Tax is always a political subject as it is inherently about countries and laws and money. ;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is science;It is about the earth's atmosphere and mentions carbon, sulphur and chemicals so it is definitely about science. There is no reference to leisure and the context is about the planet and environment which are science topics. ;;3.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;This is also very tricky to classify as it is so vague and could be within the context of politics or science. I think, overall, it is leisure as it refers to one being able to do what they want and makes reference to leisure activities.;;2.0;No, it is science;The text is factual, and talks about scientific reasoning so it is about science. It is not leisure, as the AI guessed, as the context is about batteries and why something works in a certain way.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;It is about culture and Americans. The text talks about religion and civilisation and whilst it's not very 'political' it is definitely about politics. ;;3.0;Yes, I agree it is science;I think that this text is very vague and it doesn't actually reference a specific thing, which makes it hard to classify. I think the general context is about aerials which is most related to science.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is science;This is definitely a science text. The text mentions sound frequency and voltage and is very factual. There are also some unusual science- type words included. ;;3.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;I think that this text is quite tricky to classify, as it's not 'super political' and there are elements of leisure and science (conspiracy theories and pacts). I think it gives an opinion, and talks about something within the context of politics.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;The text is about driving, which I would classify as leisure. Although there is a slight bit of factual information, the main context is about driving and doing something 'for fun' and being on a bike. Definitely not politics or science.;;2.0;No, it is politics;I think the text belongs to politics as it is about laws, regulations, countries etc. It is not science, as there is no reference to scientific facts and international arms trafficking is related to politics, laws rather than anything to do with science.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The text is about currency and different countries, Japan and America. It is definitely politics as it talks about opinions, wealth and distribution. It is definitely not about leisure or science.;;3.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;Even though there are mathematical equations and arguably some science info here, the overall context is about sports and baseball so it falls under leisure. There is mention of a ball, strike etc so this is still leisure-based. ;

This is a science based explanation.;;3.0;No, it is science;I think it is most likely to be a history topic which could be categorised under science as it  deals with the description of a society. I don't think it is politics as it is not dealing with societal systems.;;3.0;No, it is leisure;It's actually really hard to classify but as the main focus seems to be getting back at someone via an aerial on a passenger car I would say it is leisure rather than either of the other categories.;;3.0;Yes, I agree it is science;It is referring to using a chip to control an led. The led is to come on at certain sound frequencies which is usually only of interest in a science project.

Antennae does not necessarily mean that this is scientifically related. Ants have antennae though I would not classify this insect in a science category. I believe this should be in the leisure category as it relates to driving, which can be seen as a leisure activity.;;2.0;No, it is leisure;There is not enough technical information to denote this a science. It does however mention where the chip can be purchased.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;People are mentioned in this passage also the word decisions.

Cincy also references a place which I would associate with the leisure class.;5.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The input passage was very heavy on law and tax which made me automatically think this would be classed as politics.;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is science;A lot of key words such as earth, planet and different chemicals indicate this is scientific literature. The topic sounds like it is about space.;;4.0;No, it is politics;I think this should be slightly in favour of politics in my opinion. The passage is about going to work, so I knew the context when AI didn't, although I can see why they chose leisure. The first key word for me was law so I chose politics although it was hard to call.;;2.0;No, it is science;It is clear from the first sentence that some kind of reaction is being talked about, added with the words temperature and sulfation and this gave me no doubt I was read something with scientific context. ;;3.0;No, it is leisure;I actually think this input could be fitted in to all 3 classes but I will side with leisure as this is talking about history which is a hobby to some and therefore, would fit in with leisure. Again, context has a lot to do with it and the combination of words but in the last paragraph it asks you to read about an expedition which sounds leisurely, Reading is also a hobby.;;3.0;No, it is leisure;The input reads like it is two friends messaging each other about a topic they're interested in, so even though it might be to do with aerials, I would class this bit of text to do with leisure, and two friends bonding over a hobby perhaps.;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is science;Decoder chip and frequency are very scientific terms so I immediately saw this as a scientific class text. ;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;I thought it was between politics and science as it sounded like an experiment or something similar had gone wrong. Conspiracy shouldn't be related to science, however, so I chose politics after taking in to account the input included words like evasive action and weapons.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;I also thought it would be classed as leisure when I saw the word drive as this relates to motor which is a buzzword in the leisure class. I didn't know what pillioned meant so had to look it up and that also makes sense.;;2.0;No, it is politics;From the start of the second paragraph it was clear to me this would be classed as politics. It is often about context and just by using the terms data, software and technical, no context is necessarily provided. 'Arrested' and 'international arms trafficker' provide much more context and clarity.;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The reiteration of the word economy and the topic of economy made it clear to me this related to the politics class. ;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;In context, I think it is leisure as it two people speaking about a game even though the words are very sciency. ;

Mentions of a shoulder injury also imply that the subject of the passage is physical, reducing the likelihood that the text is political or scientific in nature (though, of course, it's not at all impossible). ";5.0;No, it is leisure;The author of the text seems to be more interested in acquiring practical information relevant to the leisure activity of buying a new car, and less interested in discussion the legal and social ramifications of such policies. They just want to maximize their budget, and that happens to interact with local tax regulations. ;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is science;The text focuses on the development of different physical and chemical processes as related to the Earth's atmosphere and environment. However, the Atomic Energy Commission is a government agency, and the text also seems to be taking a political stance on certain environmental practices, perhaps with the intent to advise or warn public officials. ;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;Personally, I found this portion of text to be a bit difficult to classify. I agree that it can be classified as leisure since it focuses of the quotidian human experience as it relates to the free usage of time. However, the text also seems to provide an explanation for why one might associate with unwanted people. I can kind of envision this text being included as part of a slightly informal psychology or sociology article. ;;3.0;No, it is science;While perhaps the passage could related to some sort of hobby, the passage seems be more focused on explaining why some physical phenomenon occurs, albeit, a bit informally. The uses official terms for physical processes to further make its point. ;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The post is focused on discussion surrounding Native American culture between two different time periods and how that culture evolved as the Native Americans interacted more with the European settlers (implied by the mentions of organized religious practices on Sunday). While not a contemporary issue, such discussion could certainly be a bit contentious, and related to ongoing American political issues. ;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is science;"While the nature of the text is a bit ambiguous, the email format and the comment ""this is the first truly useful piece of information I have heard in a long time"" imply that this is a work-related conversation. The comment ""That is such a wickedly cool idea"" implies that their job encourages new ideas and excitement towards the world. Lastly, the mentioning of the antennas seems particularly scientific.  ";;5.0;Yes, I agree it is science;The passage makes use of terms such as 'chip', 'frequency', 'semiconductor', etc, in an informative and formal manner. ;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The text seems to be referring to the outcome and development of tragic events, with a focus on different theories and perspectives that people may have regarding the event. The tone of the passage is also less conciliatory and more argumentative, implying a critical view, but ultimately subjective on the topic, which is more common with political discussion and debate.  ;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;While the text is a bit negative in tone and is more focused on safety, it is ultimately trying to address safety concerns associated with cycling, a leisure activity. ;;5.0;No, it is politics;Though the text makes some mention of scientific words like 'data' and 'software', the focus is clearly on the laws surrounding the international sale of strategic and powerful software, and the ambiguous legal classification of such actions due to the novelty of the litigation. ;;5.0;No, it is science;The author of the announcement seems to be a respected researcher conducting a study. While not related to scientific phenomenon, the study, ideally, would adhere to the requirements of the scientific method. ;;3.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;While the text mentions some calculations, keywords such as 'ball', 'UMP', and 'plate' imply that the passage is about baseball. While the calculations could imply some sort of scientific inquiry about the ball, the informal nature of the text and its stated objective (to appreciate the UMP's grasp of the rules), makes it less likely so. ;

It's talking about sports in the context of an individual sportsman's career, rather than the science of sports.;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;This is a discussion of tax rules and how they vary in different areas. It is specifically discussing the legality of certain tax loopholes, which makes it clearly political. It doesn't discuss cars from the perspective of an enthusiast, only from a legal and financial point of view.;;3.0;No, it is politics;Though the discussion is rooted in climate science, the text is opinion-based and making an argument for climate intervention. The actual scientific details are minimal, so the text comes across as more of a political stance.;;3.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;Because this piece of text is short, it lacks context, which makes it difficult to categorise. Though it mentions a list of leisure activities, it seems to be referring to the societal expectations of engaging in them, so it could go on to be more of a sociological discussion. However, based on only this snippet, I would also have to make the classification of leisure.;;3.0;No, it is science;While we might infer that the batteries discussed are being used in a leisure activity, we can't confirm this. The actual message of the text is a scientific explanation of the battery's efficiency under different conditions. Even though it is given in a casual way- in the context of friendly advice- it's still an explanation of technological concepts.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;This is clearly a discussion of history, presented in a debate-like format, which to me fits the category of political. Because it concerns culture and the formation of government, it's clear that the text is discussing political history rather than, for example, art history, which may fall into the leisure category.;;4.0;No, it is leisure;"Though it's hard to understand the context of the text, it seems to be discussing a prank or trick as a form of revenge- ""getting back"" at someone for something they have done to the writer. If this is the case, it's a discussion about a relationship or a fun joke, which fits best into the leisure category. Regardless, no scientific detail is given.";;5.0;Yes, I agree it is science;"This text gives technological details, making it clearly science based. It doesn't refer to applying these details to a specific leisure activity; even if that might be inferred, it can't be confirmed.";;5.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;Though it's unclear what tragedy the speaker is referring to, the implications of 'evasive action' to avoid 'being held responsible' seem political, whether politicians are the accountable ones or the ones the responsible parties are accountable to. The discussion of 'conspiracy' also implies a political context.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;The text is giving an individual opinion on the safest way to engage in a leisure activity (biking).  It analyses the author's mindset in a casual and conversational way rather than appearing to attempt true psychoanalysis, so I wouldn't classify it as science.;;3.0;No, it is politics;Though scientific terms are used in the text, it is discussing the law and how it applies to specific technologies, rather than those technologies themselves. There is analysis of regulations and legislature (political topics) but no actual scientific details are given.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;This is a survey of political opinion on the topic of economics. It's talking about citizens' view on the way national economies are globally influenced, which makes it clearly political in more than one way.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;This text refers to specific rules of a sport, presumably baseball. Though some mathematical information is given, it's only in relation to the writer's understanding of the rules and opinion of how well they are enforced.;

Whilst it does mention vehicles it is in the context of sales taxes in certain states so that relates to politics rather than leisure activities associated with vehicles. ;;3.0;Yes, I agree it is science;I think this is a science based text but it is not so clear cut. Because the written English is rather poor it could almost be politics as it might be talking about climate deniers but based on everything L think science is the correct answer.;;2.0;No, it is politics;The passage is describing how someone does not like to mix with certain other people but has to do so in order to shop, work and undertake leisure activities. It is more likely that the person has a problem with people of a particular colour or sexual orientation but has to mix with them in order to carry out normal day to day activities, a nuance that an AI device might miss.;;4.0;No, it is science;The passage is clearly talking about a battery and the impact of it placed on a cold concrete floor. There is nothing to indicate that it is to do with a vehicle and therefore it is just as likely to be part of a science experiment or technology thus making science a better option to use.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The long passage does describe the lifestyle and activities of a complex society that had been established over many years, it would be fair to say that this meets the definition associated with politics;;1.0;No, it is politics;The passage does talk about aerials but on closer reading it also goes on the talk about possibly being seen as they are often near the driver's side of the vehicle and also taking real guts to do it, it is much more likely to be talking about revenge after a domestic related argument where the victim is intending to cause damage to the aerial of the vehicle belong to the perpetrator.;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is science;Whilst I did not really understand the devices being described in the passage the overall message was clearly a scientific one and how to construct a simple piece of scientific equipment. ;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The text has some long passages talking about cults and conspiracy theories so the only real option is for politics.;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;The passage describes clearly the giving of a pillion ride to another person and the risk of being too cautious in riding in order to protect them when it would be better to just ride normally and almost forget that they are on the back of the bike. ;;2.0;No, it is politics; am confident that this is not science but politics, the passage talks about having the matter tested by lawyers in the courts and the potential for being arrested for being an arms dealer. For me, this puts it into the politics class rather than science, the scientific terms are used but in a legalistic manner;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The passage clearly describes economic growth for the two countries of Japan and America. It asks people to rate two options for growth and their preference for either one. It fits the politics option.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;This is much more clear cut in the passage. The text is clearly describing the passage of the ball passing over the batting plate in a game of baseball;

Except I gave it a 4 because we are also dealing with economics of taxation.;;4.0;No, it is politics;I agree with the models association with science because the science if environmentalism is such but in realty, for me,  politics presides heavy over climate change/environmentalism;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;The text describes to me the sociology and psychology of leisure, because it is about what the individual wants to do which are clearly leisure activities;;1.0;No, it is science;Its quite obviously science, the text describes a short science with temperature, self-discharge and sulfation behind a battery so for me its pretty clear.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The topic strongly implies anthropology, sociology and culture closely related to politics, I personally ten to associated with this type of history with politics so I think its the right choice.;;3.0;No, it is leisure;It sounds like a conversation between two people over leisure, mid conversation a suggestion is made which has some science involved in relation to position an ariel but overwhelmingly a passing suggestion to a leisurely conversation so I class in this category.;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is science;Anything dealing with technology, particularly chips requires an immense dose of science, its a no brainer choice for me. In addition scientific numbers and words used throughout the text.;;3.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;Nothing in the text indicated anything directly political to me but the words under explanation can be associated with politics. It could just as well be interpreted under religion.;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;Safety and bike riding, a clear leisure activity, therefore belongs in this category.

The word people can really lean towards any classification though. ;;2.0;No, it is science;The way the text is seemingly analysing an event and explaining an occurrence that has to do with technology makes me feel that this mostly has to do with science. It can also link with leisure as well, but mostly science. ;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The text is describing a lot of history and human relations/cultures, something that I feel builds the base of a lot of politics. ;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is science;I feel that because this text is about vehicles, information, and using both of these for an improvement in technology, I think its science. ;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is science;Because the text is primarily about technology, I feel that this is mostly about science, though leisure may also be in the running here. ;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The text and some of the key words leaning towards politics(talking, people, action, agree) all have to do with public relations and governance, making me agree that this text belongs to the class of politics.  ;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;The text describes an activity and specifics about it that one could learn from to better their own experience with the activity, something I associate with those who talk about leisure. ;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is science;Though the words state and law lean somewhat more towards politics, the clear identification of words relating to technology and the analyses of an event (with the word could) makes me agree that these words lean towards science. ;;3.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;Because the survey questions have to do with nations and economy, I do feel that the text mainly had to do with politics, but the fact that it involves a survey gathering information makes me think it is equally about science.

I think the fact it references specific plays ties it into sport, and mentions teams as well. So I think all these fit into it being a sport/Lesiure ;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;The text consists of questions directly about the laws and tax policies of US states, regarding sales tax and a few other things when new car purchases are involved. It asks which state charges sale tax. I feel like this talk of California's taxes leans it into the politics section more than any other topic. I don't deem it as leisure as this isn't an individual talking about them personally buying it, but discussing the tax in particular ;;5.0;Yes, I agree it is science;Yeah id agree this is science it mentions a lot of technical concepts, and talks alot about poisoning the earth,  which generally falls under the science category. I was leaning between this and politics but the issue is it's not talking about policy or anything with it. So I feel like science fits it better for now. ;;4.0;No, it is politics;Social commentary I think? It's really hard to tell I think it definitely doesn't fit into leisure just because it mentions a bunch of leisure related activities. ;;3.0;No, it is science;I think this should be categorised as science because it is is explaining the reasons why a battery loses charge faster when exposed to cold surfaces. It discusses some technical concepts, and this level of detail would suggest it's purely scientific and not leisure activities. ;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;I think due to the discussing native American culture and societies and how they've been portrayed. It raises some points about the differences in culture and due to it critiquing generalisations about native American cultures I think it's a political piece or fits the bill for one.   ;;3.0;No, it is leisure;"I feel like this belongs to leisure just due to the way the conversation is worded so casually like for example ""wickedly cool idea"" the whole casual tone of this really throws off the fact it is about science. I feel like the woman is probably suggesting a trick or a prank as revenge for something using a car antenna of some sort. Which is why Id place it under leisure. ";;4.0;No, it is leisure;I think it's leisure actually, just based on it talking about things being easy to use, it being cheap and simple to use and the recommendation of the guide. This feels like something being aimed at a hobby, rather than professional engineer. I think considering the cheapness of the chip too this is clearly more targeted towards being a hobby post. ;;3.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;"I would say its correct on this being politics due to its correct identification of words, and also this seems like a piece about politics or some form of government conspiracy in my opinion. Or a reaction to such events, probably something that went bad with the police. As well as it using terms like ""evasive action to avoid being held responsible""  ";;4.0;Yes, I agree it is leisure;This ones a tough call, but I feel like it is leisure as its about taking someone out on a bike and learning not to get distracted and focusing on it, it isn't science and it definitely isn't political and it focuses more on the hobby rather than the idea of the science or politics? ;;3.0;No, it is politics;I think the fact the entire text is analysing and interoperating legal documentation surrounding certain regulations, and how they could stand up in court and the fact the discusses questions like espionage and arms trafficking, it's more likely this is tied to politics. This is clearly more suited to politics than science. ;;4.0;Yes, I agree it is politics;This survey is touching o national economics,  the fact it's coming from a .edu email as well rather than a causal use email provider suggests more professional use other than, there's a lack of scientific framing yes this is a study.

It doesn't relate to leisure or science at all in my view.;No;;Yes, I agree it is leisure;I would put it under leisure because it relates to riding a bike which is a leisure pursuit, it does mention safety concerns but on an individual level so I would call that leisure whereas if it was about bringing in safety laws it might be considered politics. There is no scientific nature to it in my view.;No;;No, it is politics;I would say it is politics because it relates to laws and what would happen if someone took arms overseas which could fit under the umbrella of politics since laws are made by politicians and are discussed as political issues. It isn't at all scientific or leisure orientated.;Yes;;Yes, I agree it is politics;I think it would come under politics because it discusses the economy which is a big topic in politics and not science or leisure. It also talks about surveying Americans on if they would rather their economy grew at a faster rate but Japan's economy was growing faster or if they would rather the rate was lower but equal to Japan which seems like a political issue since it relates to nationalism and national competitiveness. ;Yes;;Yes, I agree it is leisure;Ultimately I would put this text under leisure because it is solely focused on sport which is a leisure topic and while it does include some scientific content in the calculation of the ball it still ties it back to sport and only expands as much as necessary to judge a rule within the sport and how it is called.;Yes
