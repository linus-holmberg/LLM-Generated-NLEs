Notably, other words such as 'enough' and 'hot' also contributed positively to the 'science' category, even though their influence is more minimal.","'idea': 0.259, 'gas': -0.143, 'ignite': 0.055, 'enough': 0.042, 'hay': -0.016, 'hot': 0.013"
"The model classified the input text as related to 'science' with a high degree of confidence (94.1%). This decision was influenced by several key phrases in the text. Words that supported the 'science' classification include 'technical', 'therapy', and 'treatment', indicating a scientific or medical context. Despite some words like 'post' being counter-indicative of the 'science' category, their influence was outweighed by the positive indicators. The mention of appreciation ('thanks') also played a role in the decision, perhaps due to its common usage in formal or academic discourse.","'technical': 0.074, 'post': -0.040, 'might': 0.037, 'thanks': 0.035, 'therapy': 0.034, 'treatment': 0.031"
"The Support Vector Machine (SVM) identifies the given text as related to the topic of 'leisure' with a high confidence level of 0.839 (on a scale of 0-1). The model arrived at this using key terms in your text. The words 'guy', 'Good', 'IMHO', and 'Michael' support the 'leisure' classification. However, words like 'flick' and 'bout' are slightly against the model's decision. Overall, the balance of evidence leans towards 'leisure', hence the model's prediction.","'guy': 0.210, 'flick': -0.059, 'Good': 0.040, 'IMHO': 0.035, 'bout': -0.031, 'Michael': 0.028"
"The model has predicted the provided text to belong to the 'leisure' category with 86.7% confidence.

The phrases 'engine' and 'liter' have had a significant impact on this prediction, indicating themes of leisure activities like mechanics or car-related hobbies. The use of the term 'named' had a minor positive influence on this prediction. 

On the contrary, 'uses', 'interesting' and 'true' slightly contributed against this prediction being 'leisure', implying these words might be more indicative of other categories like 'science' or 'politics'. However, their influence wasn't strong enough to sway the model's decision. 

In summary, the model identified key features related to leisure activities (like cars and engines) which led to it categorising the input text under 'leisure'.","'engine': 0.348, 'liter': 0.153, 'uses': -0.119, 'interesting': -0.047, 'named': 0.046, 'true': -0.035"
"The text given is about the author's personal experiences with their car's locking lugnuts. The model predicted the topic of the input text as 'leisure' with a high confidence of 93.8%. 

Supporting this prediction, the appearance of words 'car', 'tire', 'Saturn', 'tires' and 'dealer' related to leisurely activities or hobbies, like car maintenance and driving. Although the word 'service' was found, which might indicate a more professional or political context, its influence was negative, meaning it was more likely pulling the categorisation away from 'leisure', but not enough to change the model's overall prediction.","'car': 0.177, 'tire': 0.061, 'service': -0.037, 'Saturn': 0.036, 'tires': 0.031, 'dealer': 0.027"
"The model classified the text as belonging to the ""science"" category with a high confidence of 92.4%. This prediction was heavily influenced by words such as ""Radio"", ""Australia"", ""Cost"", and ""IR"". Words like ""Radio"" and ""IR"" suggest scientific conversations about Radio wavelengths and Infrared technology, and ""Cost"" implies a detailed, factual discussion. Notably, word ""carrying"" which may indicate a context of transportation, conversely contributed against this prediction. However overall, the balance of influencing factors tilted towards a ""Science"" category prediction.","'Radio': 0.110, 'Australia': 0.105, 'carrying': -0.070, 'Cost': 0.062, 'IR': 0.050, 'Shack': 0.042"
"Based on the provided text, the model predicted the category to be 'leisure' with a confidence level of 57.4%. The prediction was chiefly influenced by the recurring theme of drivers and driving, which are often associated with leisure activities like traveling or road trips. Additionally, the use of the term 'wave' added to this context of leisurely activities. At the same time, terms like 'country', 'support', and 'used' were not completely aligned with the leisure context, which might have affected the model's confidence being lower than 100%.","'drivers': 0.214, 'driving': 0.139, 'country': -0.109, 'support': -0.105, 'used': -0.081, 'wave': 0.073"
"The model classified your text as 'leisure' with a confidence score of 76.7%. This classification is heavily influenced by certain key phrases or words in your text. Words like 'twin', 'please', 'Johnny', and 'think' are key indicators that led to this classification. However, words like 'boxer' and 'examples' counteract this to some extent, suggesting less significance towards the 'leisure' category. The word 'twin' had the most impact on this prediction.","'twin': 0.199, 'boxer': -0.109, 'please': 0.091, 'Johnny': 0.070, 'examples': -0.063, 'think': 0.039"
"The Support Vector Machine model classifies your input text as 'politics' with a high confidence level of 0.976 out of 1. This decision by the model is largely influenced by certain key words or features present in your text. 

For example, the model focused on words like 'people', 'Gaza', 'would', 'land', and 'parties' which are typically associated with political discussions. The presence of these words enhances the likelihood of your text being about politics. The word 'American' also contributed to the model's classification, although it may be associated with other contexts too. 

It's essential to note that this output does not represent the absolute accuracy of the model, but indicates how confident it is based on the presence of these features in your text.","'people': 0.052, 'Gaza': 0.044, 'would': 0.036, 'land': 0.036, 'parties': 0.030, 'american': 0.027"
"The model predicts that the given text is related to the category ""science"" with a confidence level of 0.812. This is mainly because the text contains significant words like ""key"" and ""steps"", which are often associated with scientific or technical descriptions.

However, the model also identified words like ""weapon"" and ""weapons"", which are typically associated with political or military topics. This lowers the confidence slightly as these terms mildly contradict the predicted category of ""science"".

Additional names like ""Tom"" and ""Doug"" were identified but these don't significantly impact the prediction. The presence of these terms don't strongly motivate a separate category from the predicted ""science"". 

In essence, the model views the text as being about a process or steps, a common theme in scientific literature, thus predicting it to be in the ""science"" category with a fairly high confidence.","'key': 0.258, 'weapon': -0.146, 'weapons': -0.094, 'steps': 0.080, 'Tom': 0.058, 'Doug': 0.055"
